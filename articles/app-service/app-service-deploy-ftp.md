# Deploy your app to Azure App Service using FTP/S

This article shows you how to use FTP or FTPS to deploy your web app, mobile app backend, 
or API app to [Azure App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529714).

The FTP/S endpoint for your app is already active. No configuration is necessary to enable FTP/S deployment.

## Step 1: Set deployment credentials

To access the FTP server for your app, you first need deployment credentials. 

To set or reset your deployment credentials, see [Azure App Service Deployment Credentials](app-service-deployment-credentials.md). This tutorial demonstrates the use of user-level credentials.

## Step 2: Get FTP connection information

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your app's [resource page](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md#manage-resources).
2. Select **Overview** in the left menu, then note the values for **FTP/Deployment User**, **FTP Host Name**, and **FTPS Host Name**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To provide proper context for the FTP server, the **FTP/Deployment User** value displayed by the Azure portal includes the app name.
    > You can find the same information when you select **Properties** in the left menu. 
    >
    > Also, the deployment password is never shown. If you forget your deployment password, go back to [step 1](#step1) and reset your deployment password.
    >

## Step 3: Deploy files to Azure

1. From your FTP client (for example, [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)), 
use the connection information you gathered to connect to your app.
3. Copy your files and their respective directory structure to the [**/site/wwwroot** directory](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/File-structure-on-azure) in Azure (or the **/site/wwwroot/App_Data/Jobs/** directory for WebJobs).
4. Browse to your app's URL to verify the app is running properly. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Unlike [Git-based deployments](app-service-deploy-local-git.md), FTP deployment doesn't support the following deployment automations: 
>
> - dependency restores (such as NuGet, NPM, PIP, and Composer automations)
> - compilation of .NET binaries
> - generation of web.config (here is a [Node.js example](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Using-a-custom-web.config-for-Node-apps))
> 
> Generate these necessary files manually on your local machine, and then deploy them together with your app.

## Next steps

For more advanced deployment scenarios, try [deploying to Azure with Git](app-service-deploy-local-git.md). Git-based deployment to Azure
enables version control, package restore, MSBuild, and more.
