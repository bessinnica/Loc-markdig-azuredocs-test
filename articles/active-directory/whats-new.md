### Sign-in with additional risk detected

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

The insight you get for a detected risk event is tied to your Azure AD subscription. With the Azure AD Premium P2 edition, you get the most detailed information about all underlying detections.

**Service category:** Azure AD  
**Product capability:** Directory
 

As of January 8, 2018, the Azure AD administration experience in the Azure classic portal has been retired. This took place in conjunction with the retirement of the Azure classic portal itself.

**What's available?**

As part of the transition to the new admin console, we have made 2 new APIs available for retrieving Azure AD Activity Logs. The new set of APIs provide richer filtering and sorting functionality in addition to providing richer audit and sign-in activities. The data previously available through the security reports can now be accessed through the Identity Protection risk events API in Microsoft Graph.

For more information, see:

- [Get started with the Azure Active Directory reporting API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started-azure-portal)

### New Azure AD sign-in experience

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD  
**Product capability:** User authentication
 
The Azure AD and Microsoft account identity system UIs were redesigned so that they have a consistent look and feel. In addition, the Azure AD sign-in page collects the user name first, followed by the credential on a second screen.

For more information, see [The new Azure AD sign-in experience is now in public preview](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/08/02/the-new-azure-ad-signin-experience-is-now-in-public-preview/).

### Fewer sign-in prompts: A new "keep me signed in" experience for Azure AD sign-in

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD  
**Product capability:** User authentication
 
The **Keep me signed in** check box on the Azure AD sign-in page was replaced with a new prompt that shows up after you successfully authenticate. 

If you respond **Yes** to this prompt, the service gives you a persistent refresh token. This behavior is the same as when you selected the **Keep me signed in** check box in the old experience. For federated tenants, this prompt shows after you successfully authenticate with the federated service.

For more information, see [Fewer sign-in prompts: The new "keep me signed in" experience for Azure AD is in preview](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/09/19/fewer-login-prompts-the-new-keep-me-signed-in-experience-for-azure-ad-is-in-preview/).

### Add configuration to require the terms of use to be expanded prior to accepting

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Terms of use  
**Product capability:** Governance
 
An option for administrators requires their users to expand the terms of use prior to accepting the terms.

Select either **On** or **Off** to require users to expand the terms of use. The **On** setting requires users to view the terms of use prior to accepting them.

For more information, see the [Azure AD terms of use feature (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-tou).

### Scoped activation for eligible role assignments

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
You can use scoped activation to activate eligible Azure resource role assignments with less autonomy than the original assignment defaults. An example is if you're assigned as the owner of a subscription in your tenant. With scoped activation, you can activate the owner role for up to five resources contained within the subscription (such as resource groups and virtual machines). Scoping your activation might reduce the possibility of executing unwanted changes to critical Azure resources.

For more information, see [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure).

- **Ensure macOS devices adhere to your organization's compliance policies defined in Intune.** In Intune on the Azure portal, you now can set up compliance policies for macOS devices. 
- **Restrict access to applications in Azure AD to only compliant macOS devices.** Conditional access policy authoring has macOS as a separate device platform option. Now you can author macOS-specific conditional access policies for the targeted application set in Azure.

For more information, see:

### Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication 


**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:**  Multi-factor authentication  
**Product capability:** User authentication




The Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication adds cloud-based multi-factor authentication capabilities to your authentication infrastructure by using your existing servers.

You don't have to install, configure, and maintain new servers. 

This extension was created for organizations that want to protect virtual private network connections without deploying the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server. The Network Policy Server extension acts as an adapter between RADIUS and cloud-based Azure Multi-Factor Authentication to provide a second factor of authentication for federated or synced users.


For more information, see [Integrate your existing Network Policy Server infrastructure with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-nps-extension).

For more information, see [Controls in Azure AD conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-controls).

 
---

### Aggregation of real-time risk events


**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Identity protection  
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection


In Azure AD Identity Protection, all real-time risk events that originated from the same IP address on a given day are now aggregated for each risk event type. This change limits the volume of risk events shown without any change in user security.

The underlying real-time detection works each time the user signs in. If you have a sign-in risk security policy set up to multi-factor authentication or block access, it is still triggered during each risky sign-in.

## October 2017


### Deprecate Azure AD reports


**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting

### Automatic sign-in field detection


**Type:** Fixed   
**Service category:** My Apps  
**Product capability:** Single sign-on  



Azure AD supports automatic sign-in field detection for applications that render an HTML user name and password field.

You can find this capability by adding a *Non-Gallery* application on the **Enterprise Applications** page in the [Azure portal](http://aad.portal.azure.com). Additionally, you can configure the **Single Sign-on** mode on this new application to **Password-based Single Sign-on**, enter a web URL, and then save the page.
 
Due to a service issue, this functionality was temporarily disabled. The issue was resolved, and the automatic sign-in field detection is available again.

---

### New multi-factor authentication features


**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Multi-factor authentication  
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection  



Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an essential part of protecting your organization. To make credentials more adaptive and the experience more seamless, the following features were added: 

- Multi-factor challenge results are directly integrated into the Azure AD sign-in report, which includes programmatic access to MFA results.
- The MFA configuration is more deeply integrated into the Azure AD configuration experience in the Azure portal.

With this public preview, MFA management and reporting are an integrated part of the core Azure AD configuration experience. Now you can manage the MFA management portal functionality within the Azure AD experience.

For more information, see [Reference for MFA reporting in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-activity-sign-ins-mfa).
