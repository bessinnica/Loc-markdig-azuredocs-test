# Azure AD Domain Services - Troubleshooting Network Security Group configuration



## AADDS104: Network error

**Alert message:**
 *Microsoft is unable to reach the domain controllers for this managed domain. This may happen if a network security group (NSG) configured on your virtual network blocks access to the managed domain. Another possible reason is if there is a user defined route that blocks incoming traffic from the internet.*

The most common cause of network errors for Azure AD Domain Services can be attributed to incorrect NSG configurations. To ensure that Microsoft can service and maintain you managed domain, you must use a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow access to [specific ports](active-directory-ds-networking.md#ports-required-for-azure-ad-domain-services) inside your subnet. If these ports are blocked, Microsoft cannot access the resources it needs, which may be detrimental to your service. While creating your NSG, keep these ports open to ensure no interruption in service.

## Sample NSG
The following table depicts a sample NSG that would keep your managed domain secure while allowing Microsoft to monitor, manage, and update information.

>[!NOTE]
> Azure AD Domain Services requires unrestricted outbound access. We recommend to not create any additional outboud rule to your NSGs.

## Adding a rule to a Network Security Group using the Azure portal
If you do not want to use PowerShell, you can manually add single rules to NSGs using the Azure portal. Follow these steps to create rules in your Network security group.

1. Navigate to the [Network security groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FNetworkSecurityGroups) page in the Azure portal
2. Choose the NSG associated with your domain from the table.
3. Under Settings in the left-hand navigation, click either **Inbound security rules** or **Outbound security rules**.
4. Create the rule by clicking **Add** and filling in the information. Click **OK**.
5. Verify your rule has been created by locating it in the rules table.


## Create a default NSG using PowerShell

Preceding are steps you can use to create a new NSG using PowerShell that keeps all of the ports needed to run Azure AD Domain Services open while denying any other unwanted access.


This resolution requires installing and running [Azure AD Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?toc=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory-domain-services%2Ftoc.json&view=azureadps-2.0).

1. Connect to your Azure AD directory.

  ```PowerShell
  # Connect to your Azure AD directory.
  Connect-AzureAD
  ```
2. Log in to your Azure subscription.

  ```PowerShell
  # Log in to your Azure subscription.
  Login-AzureRmAccount
  ```

3. Create an NSG with three rules. The following script defines three rules for the NSG that allow access to the ports needed to run Azure AD Domain Services. Then, the script creates a new NSG that contains those rules. You are welcome to add additional rules as you see fit using the same format.

  ```PowerShell
  # Create the rules needed
  $rule1 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name https-rule -Description "Allow HTTP" `
  -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 101 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 443
  $rule2 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name manage-3389 -Description "Manage domain through port 3389" `
  -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 102 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 3389
  $rule3 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name manage-5986 -Description "Manage domain through port 5986" `
  -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 103 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix $serviceIPs -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 5986
  # Create the NSG with the 3 rules above
  $nsg = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location westus `
  -Name "AADDS-NSG" -SecurityRules $rule1,$rule2,$rule3
  ```

4. Lastly, the script associates the NSG with the vnet and subnet of choice.

  ```PowerShell
  # Find vnet and subnet
  $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $vnetName
  $subnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -VirtualNetwork $vnet -Name $subnetName
  # Set the nsg to the subnet and save the changes
  $subnet.NetworkSecurityGroup = $nsg
  Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
  ```

### Full script

```PowerShell
#Change the following values to match your deployment
$resourceGroup = "ResourceGroupName"
$vnetName = "exampleVnet"
$subnetName = "exampleSubnet"

$serviceIPs = "52.180.183.8, 23.101.0.70, 52.225.184.198, 52.179.126.223, 13.74.249.156, 52.187.117.83, 52.161.13.95, 104.40.156.18, 104.40.87.209, 52.180.179.108, 52.175.18.134, 52.138.68.41, 104.41.159.212, 52.169.218.0, 52.187.120.237, 52.161.110.169, 52.174.189.149, 13.64.151.161"

# Create the rules needed
$rule1 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name https-rule -Description "Allow HTTP" `
-Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 101 `
-SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
-DestinationPortRange 443

$rule2 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name manage-3389 -Description "Manage domain through port 3389" `
-Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 102 `
-SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
-DestinationPortRange 3389

$rule3 = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name manage-5986 -Description "Manage domain through port 5986" `
-Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 103 `
-SourceAddressPrefix $serviceIPs -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
-DestinationPortRange 3389


# Connect to your Azure AD directory.
Connect-AzureAD

# Log in to your Azure subscription.
Login-AzureRmAccount

# Create the NSG with the 3 rules above
$nsg = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location westus `
-Name "NSG-Default" -SecurityRules $rule1,$rule2,$rule3

# Find vnet and subnet
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $vnetName
$subnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -VirtualNetwork $vnet -Name $subnetName

# Set the nsg to the subnet and save the changes
$subnet.NetworkSecurityGroup = $nsg
Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
```

>This default NSG does not lock down access to the port used for Secure LDAP. To find out how to create a rule for this port, visit [this article](active-directory-ds-troubleshoot-ldaps.md).
