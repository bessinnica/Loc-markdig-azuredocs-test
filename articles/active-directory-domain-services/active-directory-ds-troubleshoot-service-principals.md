# Azure AD Domain Services - Troubleshooting Service Principal configuration

To service, manage, and update your domain, Microsoft uses various [Service Principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects) to communicate with your directory. If one is misconfigured or deleted, it can cause a disruption in your service.

## AADDS102: Service Principal not found

**Alert message:**

*A Service Principal required for Azure AD Domain Services to function properly has been deleted from your Azure AD directory. This configuration impacts Microsoft's ability to monitor, manage, patch, and synchronize your managed domain.*

Service principals are applications that Microsoft uses to manage, update, and maintain your managed domain. If they are deleted, it breaks Microsoft's ability to service your domain. Use the following steps to determine which service principals need to be recreated.

1. Navigate to the [Enterprise Applications - All Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps) page in the Azure portal.
2. Using the Show dropdown, select **All Applications** and click **Apply**.
3. Using the following table, search for each application ID by pasting the ID into the search box and pressing enter. If the search results are empty, you must recreate the service principal by following the steps in the "resolution" column.

### Recreate a missing Service Principal with PowerShell

*Follow these steps for missing IDs: 2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36*

**Remediation:**

You need Azure AD PowerShell to complete these steps. For information on installing Azure AD PowerShell, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0.).

To address this issue, type the following commands in a PowerShell window:
1. Install-Module AzureAD
2. Import-Module AzureAD
3. Check whether the service principal required for Azure AD Domain Services is missing in your directory by executing the following PowerShell command:
      ```PowerShell
      Get-AzureAdServicePrincipal -filter "AppId eq '2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36'"
      ```
4. Create the service principal by typing the following PowerShell command:
     ```PowerShell
     New-AzureAdServicePrincipal -AppId "2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36"
     ```
5. After you have created the missing Service Principal, wait two hours and check your domain's health.


### Re-register to the Microsoft AAD namespace using the Azure portal

*Follow these steps for missing IDs: 443155a6-77f3-45e3-882b-22b3a8d431fb and abba844e-bc0e-44b0-947a-dc74e5d09022*

**Remediation:**

Use the following steps to restore Domain Services on your directory:

1. Navigate to the [Subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) page in the Azure portal.
2. Choose the subscription from the table that is associated with your managed domain
3. Using the left-hand navigation, choose **Resource Providers**
4. Search for "Microsoft.AAD" in the table and click **Re-register**
5. To check to make sure your alert is resolved, view your health alert page in two hours.


### Service Principals that self correct

*Follow these steps for missing IDs: d87dcbc6-a371-462e-88e3-28ad15ec4e64*

**Remediation:**

Microsoft can identify when specific Service Principals are missing, misconfigured, or deleted. To remedy the service quickly, Microsoft will recreate the Service Principals itself. Check your domain's health after two hours to ensure that the principal has been recreated.
