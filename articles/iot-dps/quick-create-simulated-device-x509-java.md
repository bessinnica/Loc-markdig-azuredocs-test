# Create and provision a simulated X.509 device using Java device SDK for IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service
[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-x509](../../includes/iot-dps-selector-quick-create-simulated-device-x509.md)]

These steps show how to simulate an X.509 device on your development machine running Windows OS, and use a code sample to connect this simulated device with the Device Provisioning Service and your IoT hub. 

Make sure to complete the steps in the [Setup IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before you proceed.


## Prepare the environment 

1. Make sure you have [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your machine.

1. Download and install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

1. Open a command prompt. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git --recursive
    ```

1. Navigate to the certificate generator project and build the project. 

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-tools/provisioning-x509-cert-generator
    mvn clean install
    ```

1. Navigate to the target folder and execute the created jar file.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-cert-generator-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

1. Create the enrollment information in either of the following ways, as per your setup:

    - **Individual enrollment**:

        1. Enter **N** for _Do you want to input common name_. Copy to the clipboard the output of `Client Cert` from *-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----* and ending at *-----END CERTIFICATE-----*.

            ![Individual certificate generator](./media/java-quick-create-simulated-device-x509/individual.png)

        1. Create a file named **_X509individual.pem_** on your Windows machine, open it in an editor of your choice, and copy the clipboard contents to this file. Save the file.

        1. Enter **N** for _Do you want to input Verification Code_ and keep the program output open for reference later in the Quickstart. Note the _Client Cert_ and _Client Cert Private Key_ values.
    
    - **Enrollment groups**:

        1. Enter **N** for _Do you want to input common name_. Copy to the clipboard the output of `Root Cert` from *-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----* and ending at *-----END CERTIFICATE-----*.

            ![Group certificate generator](./media/java-quick-create-simulated-device-x509/group.png)

        1. Create a file named **_X509group.pem_** on your Windows machine, open it in an editor of your choice, and copy the clipboard contents to this file. Save the file.

        1. Enter **Y** for _Do you want to input Verification Code_ and keep the program open for use later in the Quickstart. Note the _Client Cert_, _Client Cert Private Key_, _Signer Cert_, and _Root Cert_ values.

                    "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
                ```

1. Build the sample. Navigate to the target folder and execute the created jar file.

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean install
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

1. In the portal, navigate to the IoT hub linked to your provisioning service and open the **Device Explorer** blade. On successful provisioning of the simulated X.509 device to the hub, its device ID appears on the **Device Explorer** blade, with *STATUS* as **enabled**. Note that you might need to click the **Refresh** button at the top if you already opened the blade prior to running the sample device application.
