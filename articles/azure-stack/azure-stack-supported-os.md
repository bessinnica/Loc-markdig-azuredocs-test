# Guest operating systems supported on Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

## Windows
Azure Stack supports the following Windows guest operating systems. Images in the Marketplace are available for download to Azure Stack. Windows client images are not available in the Marketplace.

During deployment, Azure Stack will ensure that a suitable version of the guest agent is injected into the image.

| Operating system | Description | Publisher | OS Type | Marketplace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 | 64-bit | Microsoft | Windows | Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2012 | 64-bit | Microsoft | Windows | Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | 64-bit | Microsoft | Windows | Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2016 | 64-bit | Microsoft | Windows | Datacenter, Datacenter Core, Datacenter with Containers |
| Windows 7 | 64-bit, Pro and Enterprise | Microsoft | Windows | No |
| Windows 8.1 | 64-bit, Pro and Enterprise | Microsoft | Windows | No |
| Windows 10 *(see note 1)* | 64-bit, Pro and Enterprise | Microsoft | Windows | No |

***Note 1:***  *To deploy Windows 10 client operating systems on Azure Stack, you must have [Windows per User Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/product-licensing/windows10.aspx) or purchase through a Qualified Multitenant Hoster ([QMTH](https://www.microsoft.com/CloudandHosting/licensing_sca.aspx)).*


## Linux
