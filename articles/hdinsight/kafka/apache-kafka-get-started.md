# Start with Apache Kafka on HDInsight

Learn how to create and use an [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) cluster on Azure HDInsight. Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform that is available with HDInsight. It is often used as a message broker, as it provides functionality similar to a publish-subscribe message queue. Kafka is often used with Apache Spark and Apache Storm.

> [!NOTE]
> There are currently two versions of Kafka available with HDInsight; 0.9.0 (HDInsight 3.4) and 0.10.0 (HDInsight 3.5 and 3.6). The steps in this document assume that you are using Kafka on HDInsight 3.6.

[!INCLUDE [delete-cluster-warning](../../../includes/hdinsight-delete-cluster-warning.md)]

## Create a Kafka cluster

Use the following steps to create a Kafka on HDInsight cluster:

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource**, **Data + Analytics**, and then select **HDInsight**.
   
    ![Create a HDInsight cluster](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/create-hdinsight.png)

2. From **Basics**, enter the following information:

    * **Cluster Name**: The name of the HDInsight cluster.
    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription to use.
    * **Cluster login username** and **Cluster login password**: The login when accessing the cluster over HTTPS. You use these credentials to access services such as the Ambari Web UI or REST API.
    * **Secure Shell (SSH) username**: The login used when accessing the cluster over SSH. By default the password is the same as the cluster login password.
    * **Resource Group**: The resource group to create the cluster in.
    * **Location**: The Azure region to create the cluster in.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > For high availability of data, we recommend selecting a location (region) that contains __three fault domains__. For more information, see the [Data high availability](#data-high-availability) section.
   
 ![Select subscription](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/hdinsight-basic-configuration.png)

3. Select **Cluster type**, and then set the following values from **Cluster configuration**:
   
    * **Cluster Type**: Kafka
    * **Version**: Kafka 0.10.0 (HDI 3.6)

    Finally, use the **Select** button to save settings.
     
 ![Select cluster type](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/set-hdinsight-cluster-type.png)

4. After selecting the cluster type, use the __Select__ button to set the cluster type. Next, use the __Next__ button to finish basic configuration.

5. From **Storage**, select or create a Storage account. For the steps in this document, leave the other fields at the default values. Use the __Next__ button to save storage configuration.

    ![Set the storage account settings for HDInsight](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/set-hdinsight-storage-account.png)

6. From __Applications (optional)__, select __Next__ to continue. No applications are required for this example.

7. From __Cluster size__, select __Next__ to continue.

    > [!WARNING]
    > To guarantee availability of Kafka on HDInsight, your cluster must contain at least three worker nodes. For more information, see the [Data high availability](#data-high-availability) section.

    ![Set the Kafka cluster size](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/kafka-cluster-size.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **disks per worker node** entry controls the scalability of Kafka on HDInsight. Kafka on HDInsight uses the local disk of the virtual machines in the cluster. Kafka is I/O heavy, so [Azure Managed Disks](../../virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview.md) are used to provide high throughput and provide more storage per node. The type of managed disk can be either __Standard__ (HDD) or __Premium__ (SSD). Premium disks are used with DS and GS series VMs. All other VM types use standard.

8. From __Advanced settings__, select __Next__ to continue.

9. From the **Summary**, review the configuration for the cluster. Use the __Edit__ links to change any settings that are incorrect. Finally, use the__Create__ button to create the cluster.
   
    ![Cluster configuration summary](./media/apache-kafka-get-started/hdinsight-configuration-summary.png)
   
    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take up to 20 minutes to create the cluster.

## Connect to the cluster

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When performing the following steps, you must use an SSH client. For more information, see the [Use SSH with HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md) document.

From your client, use SSH to connect to the cluster:

```ssh SSHUSER@CLUSTERNAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net```

Replace **SSHUSER** with the SSH username you provided during cluster creation. Replace **CLUSTERNAME** with the name of the cluster.

When prompted, enter the password you used for the SSH account.

For information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

## <a id="getkafkainfo"></a>Get the Zookeeper and Broker host information

When working with Kafka, you must know two host values; the *Zookeeper* hosts and the *Broker* hosts. These hosts are used with the Kafka API and many of the utilities that ship with Kafka.

Use the following steps to create environment variables that contain the host information. These environment variables are used in the steps in this document.

1. From an SSH connection to the cluster, use the following command to install the `jq` utility. This utility is used to parse JSON documents, and is useful in retrieving the broker host information:
   
    ```bash
    sudo apt -y install jq
    ```

2. To set the environment variables with information retrieved from Ambari, use the following commands:

    ```bash
    CLUSTERNAME='your cluster name'
    export KAFKAZKHOSTS=`curl -sS -u admin -G https://$CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/$CLUSTERNAME/services/ZOOKEEPER/components/ZOOKEEPER_SERVER | jq -r '["\(.host_components[].HostRoles.host_name):2181"] | join(",")' | cut -d',' -f1,2`

    export KAFKABROKERS=`curl -sS -u admin -G https://$CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/$CLUSTERNAME/services/KAFKA/components/KAFKA_BROKER | jq -r '["\(.host_components[].HostRoles.host_name):9092"] | join(",")' | cut -d',' -f1,2`

    echo '$KAFKAZKHOSTS='$KAFKAZKHOSTS
    echo '$KAFKABROKERS='$KAFKABROKERS
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Set `CLUSTERNAME=` to the name of the Kafka cluster. When prompted, enter the password for the cluster login (admin) account.

    The following text is an example of the contents of `$KAFKAZKHOSTS`:
   
    `zk0-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.ex.internal.cloudapp.net:2181,zk2-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.ex.internal.cloudapp.net:2181`
   
    The following text is an example of the contents of `$KAFKABROKERS`:
   
    `wn1-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.cx.internal.cloudapp.net:9092,wn0-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.cx.internal.cloudapp.net:9092`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `cut` command is used to trim the list of hosts to two host entries. You do not need to provide the full list of hosts when creating a Kafka consumer or producer.
   
    > [!WARNING]
    > Do not rely on the information returned from this session to always be accurate. If you scale the cluster, new brokers are added or removed. If a failure occurs and a node is replaced, the host name for the node may change.
    >
    > You should retrieve the Zookeeper and broker hosts information shortly before you use it to ensure you have valid information.

## Create a topic

Kafka stores streams of data in categories called *topics*. From An SSH connection to a cluster headnode, use a script provided with Kafka to create a topic:

```bash
/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --replication-factor 3 --partitions 8 --topic test --zookeeper $KAFKAZKHOSTS
```

This command connects to Zookeeper using the host information stored in `$KAFKAZKHOSTS`, and then create Kafka topic named **test**. You can verify that the topic was created by using the following script to list topics:

```bash
/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper $KAFKAZKHOSTS
```

The output of this command lists Kafka topics, which contains the **test** topic.

## Produce and consume records

Kafka stores *records* in topics. Records are produced by *producers*, and consumed by *consumers*. Producers produce records to Kafka *brokers*. Each worker node in your HDInsight cluster is a Kafka broker.

Use the following steps to store records into the test topic you created earlier, and then read them using a consumer:

1. From the SSH session, use a script provided with Kafka to write records to the topic:
   
    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $KAFKABROKERS --topic test
    ```
   
    You are not returned to the prompt after this command. Instead, type a few text messages and then use **Ctrl + C** to stop sending to the topic. Each line is sent as a separate record.

2. Use a script provided with Kafka to read records from the topic:
   
    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server $KAFKABROKERS --topic test --from-beginning
    ```
   
    This command retrieves the records from the topic and displays them. Using `--from-beginning` tells the consumer to start from the beginning of the stream, so all records are retrieved.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using an older version of Kafka, you may need to replace `--bootstrap-server $KAFKABROKERS` with `--zookeeper $KAFKAZKHOSTS`.

3. Use __Ctrl + C__ to stop the consumer.

You can also programmatically create producers and consumers. For an example of using this API, see the [Kafka Producer and Consumer API with HDInsight](apache-kafka-producer-consumer-api.md) document.

## Data high availability

Each Azure region (location) provides _fault domains_. A fault domain is a logical grouping of underlying hardware in an Azure data center. Each fault domain shares a common power source and network switch. The virtual machines and managed disks that implement the nodes within an HDInsight cluster are distributed across these fault domains. This architecture limits the potential impact of physical hardware failures.

For information on the number of fault domains in a region, see the [Availability of Linux virtual machines](../../virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability.md#use-managed-disks-for-vms-in-an-availability-set) document.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend using an Azure region that contains three fault domains, and using a replication factor of 3.

If you must use a region that contains only two fault domains, use a replication factor of 4 to spread the replicas evenly across the two fault domains.

### Kafka and fault domains

Kafka is not aware of fault domains. When creating partition replicas for topics, it may not distribute replicas properly for high availability. To ensure high availability, use the [Kafka partition rebalance tool](https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight-kafka-tools). This tool must be ran from an SSH session to the head node of your Kafka cluster.

To ensure the highest availability of your Kafka data, you should rebalance the partition replicas for your topic at the following times:

* When a new topic or partition is created

* When you scale up a cluster

## Delete the cluster
