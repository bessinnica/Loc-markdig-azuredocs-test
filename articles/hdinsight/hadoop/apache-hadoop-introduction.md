# Introduction to Azure HDInsight and the Hadoop and Spark technology stack
This article provides an introduction to Azure HDInsight. Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service for enterprises. You can use open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and more. 

[!INCLUDE [hdinsight-price-change](../../../includes/hdinsight-enhancements.md)]

[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on clusters. The Hadoop technology stack includes related software and utilities, including Apache Hive, HBase, Spark, Kafka, and many others. 

To see available Hadoop technology stack components on HDInsight, see [Components and versions available with HDInsight][component-versioning]. To read more about Hadoop in HDInsight, see the [Azure features page for HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/).

[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) is an open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analytic applications. To read more about Spark in HDInsight, see the [Introduction to Spark on Azure HDInsight](../spark/apache-spark-overview.md).

## What is HDInsight and the Hadoop technology stack? 
Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of the Hadoop components from the [Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP)](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-center/hdp/). Azure HDInsight makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can use the most popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and more. With these frameworks, you can enable a broad range of scenarios such as extract, transform, and load (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.

## What is big data?

Big data is collected in escalating volumes, at higher velocities, and in a greater variety of formats than ever before. It can be historical (meaning stored) or real-time (meaning streamed from the source). See [Scenarios for using HDInsight](#scenarios-for-using-hdinsight) to learn about the most common use cases for big data.

## Why should I use HDInsight?

This section lists the capabilities of Azure HDInsight.

## Scenarios for using HDInsight

Azure HDInsight can be used for a variety of scenarios in big data processing. It can be historical data (data that's already collected and stored) or real-time data (data that's directly streamed from the source). The scenarios for processing such data can be summarized in the following categories: 

### Batch processing (ETL)

Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is a process where unstructured or structured data is extracted from heterogeneous data sources. It's then transformed into a structured format and loaded into a data store. You can use the transformed data for data science or data warehousing.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

You can use HDInsight to process streaming data that's received in real time from a variety of devices. For more information, [read this blog post from Azure that announces the public preview of Apache Kafka on HDInsight with Azure Managed disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-apache-kafka-on-hdinsight-with-azure-managed-disks/).

## Cluster types in HDInsight
HDInsight includes specific cluster types and cluster customization capabilities, such as the capability to add components, utilities, and languages.

### Spark, Kafka, Interactive Query, HBase, customized, and other cluster types
HDInsight offers the following cluster types:

* **[Apache Hadoop](https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop)**: A framework that uses [HDFS](#hdfs), [YARN](#yarn) resource management, and a simple [MapReduce](#mapreduce) programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.

* **[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)**: A parallel processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications. Spark works for SQL, streaming data, and machine learning. See [What is Apache Spark in HDInsight?](../spark/apache-spark-overview.md)

* **[Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/)**: A NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data--potentially billions of rows times millions of columns. See [What is HBase on HDInsight?](../hbase/apache-hbase-overview.md)

* **[Microsoft R Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/rserver)**: A server for hosting and managing parallel, distributed R processes. It provides data scientists, statisticians, and R programmers with on-demand access to scalable, distributed methods of analytics on HDInsight. See [Overview of R Server on HDInsight](../r-server/r-server-overview.md).

* **[Apache Storm](https://storm.incubator.apache.org/)**: A distributed, real-time computation system for processing large streams of data fast. Storm is offered as a managed cluster in HDInsight. See [Analyze real-time sensor data using Storm and Hadoop](../storm/apache-storm-sensor-data-analysis.md).

* **[Apache Interactive Query preview (AKA: Live Long and Process)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LLAP)**: In-memory caching for interactive and faster Hive queries. See [Use Interactive Query in HDInsight](../interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md).

* **[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)**: An open-source platform that's used for building streaming data pipelines and applications. Kafka also provides message-queue functionality that allows you to publish and subscribe to data streams. See [Introduction to Apache Kafka on HDInsight](../kafka/apache-kafka-introduction.md).

## Open-source components in HDInsight

Azure HDInsight enables you to create clusters with open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, HBase, and R. These clusters, by default, come with other open-source components that are included on the cluster such as [Ambari](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md), [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html), [Hive](http://hive.apache.org), [HCatalog](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog/), [Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/), [MapReduce](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/MapReduce), [YARN](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html), [Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/), [Pig](http://pig.apache.org/), [Sqoop](http://sqoop.apache.org/), [Tez](http://tez.apache.org/), [Oozie](http://oozie.apache.org/), [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/).
