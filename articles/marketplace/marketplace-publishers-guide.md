Using launch promotion, demand generation, and joint sales and marketing, your Marketplace offer portfolio can be the centerpiece of your cloud business engine. There are no fees for participating in the Marketplace. Our goal is to connect Microsoft customers with the best solutions that our partner ecosystem offers.

Take advantage of Marketplace capabilities to grow your business:

- **Generate leads and sales opportunities.** Enter new markets with an expanded portfolio of solutions on the Microsoft cloud platform. Upsell and cross-sell Marketplace offerings. 
- **Enhance business value and increase deal size with existing and new customers.** Grow deal size and address customer pain points when moving workloads to the cloud. Increase deal profitability by selling complete solutions. 
- **Get actionable insights.** Your success is our success. Get insights via the Cloud Partner Portal on what is performing, what leads you have generated, and how to maximize your campaign activities.

## What are Azure Marketplace and AppSource?

Microsoft provides two distinct Marketplace storefronts that allow partners to list offers, enable trials, and transact directly with Microsoft's customers and ecosystem: [Azure Marketplace] (https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [AppSource] (https://appsource.microsoft.com). These storefronts allow customers to find, try, and buy applications and services that accelerate their Digital Transformation, and help publishers grow their businesses by increasing access to Microsoft's customers and partner ecosystem.
 
The Marketplace storefronts are aligned to audiences and Microsoft cloud products to help customers find exactly what they need. Each storefront offers specialized publishing options, to help you maximize your publishing investment summarized by the following table:


|          |Azure Marketplace |AppSource  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Target Audience     |IT Professionals, Developers (specialist roles include DBAs, SecOps, DevOps, etc.)    | Line of Business Decision-Makers (specialist roles include Procurement, Manufacturing, Accounting, etc.)      |
|Built to Extend     |Azure         | Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365, Power BI, and Power Apps       |
|Types of Solutions and Services     |  Infrastructure Solutions and Professional Services   | Finished Line of Business Apps and Professional Services        |
|Publishing Options     |  Contact Me, Consulting Services Offer, Trial, Virtual Machine, Solution Templates, and Managed Apps       |  Contact Me, Consulting Services Offer, or Trial       |
|In-App Experience     | Azure Portal and CLI         | Office 365, Dynamics 365, Power BI, Office client apps       |

## Leveraging These Storefronts

Each storefront serves unique customer needs and enables targeting by role to allow you to offer the right solution or service based on who your customer is.

Engage IT Pros and Cloud Developers through the **Azure Marketplace** to discover, try, and buy IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS solutions:


|Customer Need  |Azure Marketplace |
|---------|---------|
|**Demands additional cloud platform functionality to meet business and technical needs**     |  Offers a growing portfolio of complementary applications and services optimized to run on Azure       |
|**Finds it challenging to discover the right application or service**    |  Provides a one-stop shop to discover, try, and buy solutions and services for Azure        |
|**Needs a scalable deployment mechanism for third-party applications and services**   | Enables the creation and configuration of scalable deployments for third-party applications and services        |
|**Requires new applications and services to integrate and work with existing solutions**  |   Easily integrates third-party applications and services with existing solutions on Azure      |

Engage Business Users by using **AppSource** to discover and try Line of Business SaaS apps and services: 


|Customer Need  |AppSource  |
|---------|---------|
|**Wants to extend Dynamics 365, Office 365, Power BI, and Power Apps functionality**   |  Allows customers to use third-party applications and services to extend Microsoft cloud platform capabilities       |
|**Finds it challenging to discover the right application or service**    |   Provides a one-stop shop to discover and trial applications and services, add-ins, and more      |
|**Needs an industry-specific Line of Business solution**   | Enables solutions for every industry so that customers can find what they need        |
|**Requires business-specific solutions**    | Enables solutions for every line of business and business issue, including customer service, HR, operations, and many more        |

## Understanding the Differences Between Storefronts

Choosing a storefront starts with identifying the target audience for your offer: Azure Marketplace is aligned to the needs of IT Professionals and Developers, and AppSource is aligned to Business Users. If your solution targets both audiences, you only need to publish once to list in both storefronts.
 
Consider the additional benefits of each storefront:

|Storefront Benefit  |Azure Marketplace  |AppSource   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Billing Flexibility**    | For Virtual Machines, 'Pay as you go' billing options, use Microsoft enterprise agreements or web direct sales models. Pricing options also include a Free Tier subscription where an offering is perpetually free, as well as a Try It Now subscription that is promotionally free for a limited period after which it converts to a paid subscription. 'Bring Your Own License' activation is also an option for supporting publishers For both billing options, in scenarios where Virtual Machines are deployed using Azure Apps (e.g., Solution Template or Managed App), all Azure resources provisioned are billed directly to the customer | AppSource offers seamless provisioning of a trial experience but does not currently offer a commerce-enabled publishing option; this enables you to leverage your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes        |
|**Facilitate Connections with Other Partners**     |Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer         |  Independent Software Vendors, Systems Integrators, and Managed Services Providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers      |
|**Automation**     |    Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer     | Leverage automated SaaS with add-in provisioning and use Solution Templates to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios        |Independent Software Vendors, Systems Integrators, and Managed Services Providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers
|**Multiple Cloud Types**     |   Publish both public cloud and on-premises solutions through Azure Stack, or publish to Azure Government and regional clouds including China and Germany      |    AppSource does not currently offer support for Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds     |
|**In-Context Presentation to Customers**     |  Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search (Virtual Machines and Solution Templates)       |  Make your solution available in the in-app experience for Microsoft products       |

## Select a Publishing Option

Each storefront supports multiple Publishing Options and Offer Types: List, Trial, and Transact. Select an offer type that best represents your application and service details. All publishing options will give partners access to lead sharing. 


|**Publishing Option**  | **Offer Type** | **Storefront**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**List**    |    Contact Me, Consulting Service     |  Azure Marketplace, AppSource       |
|**Trial**   |     Free Trial, SaaS Trial, Interactive Demo, Test Drive    |  Azure Marketplace, AppSource       |
|**Transact**     |   Virtual Machine, Solution Template, Managed Application      |    Azure Marketplace     |

### LIST

Use **Contact Me** when a Trial- or Transaction-level participation is not feasible. The benefit of this approach is that it enables publishers with a solution in-market to immediately begin receiving leads that can be nurtured into the foundational deals to start your business flywheel. However, the drawback is that customer engagement is limited, as compared with other offer types.

When the offer consists primarily of professional services (e.g., assessments, implementations, workshops), use the **Consulting Services** offer type. Offer scope, duration, and price must be fixed, must be for a single customer, and must be conducted on-site.

### TRIAL

Providing a Trial experience increases the engagement level offered to customers and therefore a richer exposure of your solution. A Trial enables customers to explore your solution before buying. With a Trial experience, you will have higher chances of promotion in the storefronts, and you should expect more and richer leads from customer engagements.
 
All Trial options are deployed into your Trial environment and/or Azure Subscription, rather than into the customer's environment or Azure Subscription. Trials should be customer-led without any additional purchases and minimal, if any, additional configuration to complete a simple use case. Trials must include free support at least for the duration of the trial period. Trial users should be nurtured and monitored along a deliberate evaluation path for best results. Publishers are encouraged to use both Marketplace leads and the publisher's own in-app intelligence to monitor and manage trial users.

There are 3 typical Trial scenarios:


|**Trial Option**  |**Key Benefits**  |**Choose this Option if...**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Free Trial**    |     Enables a customer to try your product before they buy with an automatic method to convert to paid and enables proof of concepts for the customer and joint engagement with Microsoft sales teams |     Your Solution is a Virtual Machine or Solution Template OR Your Solution is a SaaS offering AND You offer a multi-tenant SaaS product, You have a first run experience to get a customer up and running quickly, If you have a single tenant but are adding customers as 'guest users'|
**Test Drive**     |     Enables a customer to try your product before they buy AND provides a guided experience of your solution on a pre-configured setup |   Your solution is a Virtual Machine, Solution Template, or SaaS app with single tenant, or is complicated to provision OR You do not have a method to convert your trial to paid offer |
|**Interactive Demo**    |  Allows customers to see your product in action without the complexity of setup       |    Your solution requires complex setup that would be difficult to achieve in the trial period     |

#### Free Trial

Use a **Free Trial** when the solution or app offers a free-to-try, SaaS-based trial. This option drives high quality leads from interested customers, helping you start your business flywheel. Free Trials can be presented as limited use or limited duration trial accounts and should include a call-to-action to accelerate conversion to paid use of your software.

#### Test Drive

Use a **Test Drive** when the solution is deployed via one or more Virtual Machines via IaaS or SaaS Apps. The benefit of this approach is the automated provisioning of a virtual appliance or entire solution environment couched in a partner-hosted 'guided tour' of the solution for customer evaluation at no additional cost to the customer. The customer does not need to be an existing Azure customer, helping to generate higher quality leads.

There are additional benefits to a **Test Drive**:

- 27% of user searches on Marketplace are refined by users to only show offers with test drives 
- Offers with test drives generate 38% more leads than offers without 
- 36% of new customer acquisitions on Azure Marketplace come from customers that took a test drive 
- Enable Microsoft field sellers to better understand your product for Co-Sell efforts

#### Interactive Demo

Take your customers through a guided experience of your product with an **Interactive Demo**. The benefit of this option is that you can provide a trial experience without complicated provisioning for complex solutions. This option provides a customer with a look around the solution and allows the publisher to begin receiving leads that can be nurtured into foundational deals to start your business flywheel. 

### TRANSACT

In Azure Marketplace, use a **Virtual Machine** when the solution is deployed as a virtual appliance into the customer's subscription. Virtual machines are fully commerce enabled via Pay-as-You-Go or BYOL-enabled licensing models. Microsoft hosts the commerce transaction and bills the customer on behalf of the publisher. Publishers get the benefit of leveraging the customer's preferred payment relationship with Microsoft, including the Enterprise Agreement. 

>[!NOTE]
>At this time, an Enterprise Agreement's Monetary Commitments can be used against the virtual appliance's Azure usage, but not against the publisher's software license fees.

Use an **Azure Solution Template** when a solution requires additional deployment and configuration automation beyond the virtual appliance. Solution Templates can automate the provisioning of one or more virtual machine resources and in addition can provision Networking and Storage resources. Solution templates can provide automation benefits on single Virtual Machines as well as entire IaaS-based solution environments. Learn more about building Solution Templates [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs).

Use an Azure Managed App when deploying either a Virtual Machine or an entire IaaS-based solution to a customer's subscription when the publisher or customer wishes the solution to be managed by a 3rd party, for example an SI or MSP. Learn more about [building Managed Apps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/managed-applications/overview). For a list of commonly asked questions, see the [Azure Marketplace FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/faq/).

### Azure Certified

All Virtual Machines published in the Azure Marketplace are tested for the **Azure Certified** program. The program assures customers that your Virtual Machine is compatible with the Azure platform and Marketplace selling model, tests for online image safety compliance enables including viruses and malware, and enables badging at the offer-level to enhance promotion to Microsoft enterprise customers as a validated solution.

#### Marketplace Commercial Considerations

There are no fees for participating in Marketplace. There is no revenue share for participating in Marketplace when publishing using the List, Trial, and BYOL Transact options. For more details, see our [Marketplace Participation Policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/).

#### Pay-as-You-Go and Bring-Your-Own-License Billing Options

When the Pay-as-You-Go Transact publishing option is used, your usage-based software licensing revenue is shared 80% / 20% between you and Microsoft respectively. A single offer can be priced at both Pay-as-You-Go and Bring Your Own License Billing models and can co-exist at the offer level as separate SKUs. This can be configured in your Offer in the Cloud Partner Portal.

Consider this example:

If you enable Pay-as-You-Go as an option:


|Your License Cost   | $1.00 per hour        |
|---------|---------|
|Azure Usage Cost (D1/1-Core)     | $0.14 per hour  |
|**Customer is billed by Microsoft**    | **$1.14 per hour**       |

In this scenario, Microsoft bills $1.14 per hour for use of your published Virtual Machine image.


|**Microsoft bills** |**$1.14 per hour**  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft pays you 80% of your License Cost | $0.80 per hour        |
|Microsoft keeps 20% of your License Cost    | $0.20 per hour        |
|Microsoft keeps the Azure Usage Cost     |   $0.14 per hour      |

Conversely, if you enable Bring Your Own License as an option:

|Your License Cost     | License Fee negotiated and billed by Publisher        |
|---------|---------|
|Azure Usage Cost (D1/1-Core)    | $0.14 per hour         |
|**Customer is billed by Microsoft**     | **$0.14 per hour**        |

In this scenario, Microsoft bills $0.14 per hour for use of your published Virtual Machine image. 

|**Microsoft bills**    |   **$0.14 per hour**      |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft keeps the Azure Usage Cost     |    $0.14 per hour     |
|Microsoft keeps 0% of your License Cost     |  $0.00 per hour       |

### Single-Billing and Payment Methods

An important benefit of using the Transact publishing option is that Microsoft can 'single-bill' your license costs at the same time as the underlying Azure usage directly to the customer. In this scenario, Microsoft bills and collects on your behalf, eliminating the need for you to create your own procurement relationship with the customer. This can save you time and resources to focus on landing the sale, not collecting the bill.

### Enterprise Agreement

Microsoft customers sometimes use an Enterprise Agreement (EA) to pay for Microsoft products, including Azure usage. This payment option is designed for organizations that want to license software and cloud services for a minimum three-year period. Customers have the option to spread payments instead of one up-front payment. When an EA customer uses Pay-as-You-Go Transact listing, billing for the publisher's software license costs follows the quarterly EA overage billing cycle.

### Monetary Commitment 

Any Enterprise Agreement customer can add Azure to their agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. That commitment is consumed throughout the year by using any combination of the wide variety of cloud services Azure offers from its global datacenters.

## Using Azure Active Directory to Enable Trials
Azure Active Directory (AAD) is a cloud identity service that enables authentication with a Microsoft work or school account using the industry standard protocols: OAuth and OpenID Connect. Learn more about AAD [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory-features). 

Microsoft authenticates all Marketplace users with AAD, hence when an authenticated user clicks through your Trial listing in Marketplace and is re-directed to your Trial environment, you can provision the user directly into a Trial without requiring an additional sign-in step. The [token that your app receives from AAD during authentication] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims#sample-tokens) includes valuable user information that you can use to create a user account in your app, enabling you to automate the provisioning experience and increase the likelihood of conversion. 

Using AAD to enable 1-click authentication to your app or Trial:

- Streamlines the customer experience from Marketplace to Trial 
- Maintains the feel of an 'in-product experience' even when the user is redirected from Marketplace to your domain or Trial environment
- Decreases the likelihood of abandonment on redirect because there is not an additional sign-in step
- Reduces deployment barriers for the large population of AAD users

### Certifying your Azure Active Directory Integration for Marketplace

For Multi-Tenant Applications:

If you support AAD today

- Register your application in the Azure portal
- Enable multi-tenancy support feature in AAD to get 'one-click' trial experience
- [Learn more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications)

If you are new to AAD Federated SSO

- Register your application in the Azure portal
- Develop SSO with AAD using [OpenID Connect] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code) or [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code)
- Enable multi-tenancy support feature in AAD to get 'one-click' trial experience
- [Learn more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified)

For Single-Tenant Applications:

There are multiple options for single tenant applications:

- Add users to your directory as guest users using [Azure B2B] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b)
- Manually provision trials for customers via 'Contact Me'
- Develop a per customer 'Test Drive'
- Build a multi-tenant sample demo app with SSO

Once registered with Developer Center, the Partner will need to associate the Developer Center account with their Azure Marketplace Publisher Profile to publish.      |

#### Create a Microsoft ID

Through the entire Marketplace publishing process, you will use an email address that identifies the Marketplace account. This email address needs to be registered as a Microsoft ID and will be used for both the [Microsoft Developer Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/) and [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). You should have only one Microsoft ID account for your Azure Marketplace and AppSource offerings, and we highly recommend that it is not shared with other services or offers.

The email address selected should preferably be in your corporate domain and controlled by your IT team. Please review Appendix: Guidelines for creating a Microsoft ID to Manage Marketplace Account and Appendix: Guidance for Microsoft IDs in AAD Federated Domains for guidelines prior creating an ID. 

#### Submit the Marketplace Nomination Form
As part of the Marketplace onboarding process, you will need to submit a nomination form, submitting information about your application or service offer, your company's information, and the level of support that you will be providing.  
Once the form is submitted the Marketplace team will review the application and validate the request. Once the request is reviewed, you will be notified via email with the next steps that need to be completed to become an approved Partner in the Cloud Partner Portal. Please submit your nomination in:

Azure Marketplace Nomination: http://aka.ms/listonazuremarketplace   
AppSource Nomination: http://aka.ms/listonappsource

#### Register in the Developer Center

The [Microsoft Developer Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/) is used to register your company's information. The registrant must be a valid representative of the company and must provide their personal information to validate their identity. The person registering must use a Microsoft ID that is shared for the company, and the same account must be used in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You should check to make sure your company does not already have a Microsoft Developer Center account before you attempt to create one.

During the process, we will collect company address information, bank account information, and tax information. These are typically obtainable from finance or business contacts. In addition, you must complete the following Publisher profile components to progress through the various phases of offer creation and deployment:


|**Publisher Profile**  |**To Start Profile**  |**Staging**  |**List and Trial**  |**Transact**
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Company registration**     | **Must Have**        |  **Must Have**       | **Must Have**        |  **Must Have**       |
|**Tax profile ID**   |    Optional     |    Optional     |  Optional       | **Must Have**      |
|**Bank account**     |   Optional      |    Optional     |  Optional       |  **Must Have**      |

Refer to the Appendix: Instructions on how to register in the Developer Center for a step by step explanation of this process. 

#### Log in to the Cloud Partner Portal

Once you have received the approval from the Marketplace Team that the Nomination has been approved and you have registered in the [Microsoft Developer Center](https://dev.windows.com), an account will be created for you to access the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com). First-time sign-in credentials will be included in the Nomination approval email. 

Use your Marketplace account (Microsoft ID) to access your publisher profile. Once in the Cloud Partner Portal, the last step is to associate the Developer Center account with the respective Marketplace Publisher Profile to publish. This can be done in the Cloud Partner Portal in your Publisher Profile via the button at the bottom of the screen.

For detailed information on how to use the Cloud Partner Portal, please refer to the [Learn](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#Learn) menu within the portal and click in the Documentation section. 

## How to Grow your Business with Marketplace

Following best practices in marketing will help set you up for success with go-to-market and Microsoft Co-Sell initiatives, as well as maximize your business benefits through Marketplace. The [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership) is your gateway for all non-Marketplace related marketing and programmatic resources. 

The quality of your app publication and commitment to customer centric demand generation and partner engagement help drive customer growth for your business. Engaging in these activities will help Microsoft amplify go-to-market work and to feature key solutions across the marketplace storefronts. 

This section walks you through marketing best practices for an offer, according to the following checklist:

- I've optimized my listing to drive traffic and engagement.
- I've created messaging on my website, leveraging a unique landing page, to drive traffic to my Marketplace listing.
- I've published a Test Drive or other trial so that customers can experience my offer running live on Azure.
- I've planned and built my own marketing and promotions campaigns to drive awareness and engagement.
- I've enabled on-demand lead generation so that every time someone acts to test or deploy my application, I receive their name and contact information.
- I've learned about and connected with the partner resources that are available to me through the [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership).

### Create a Great Listing

Your listing in marketplace can sometimes be your first interaction with a potential customer. Like any first impression, you want to make it strong and something your audience wants to follow up on. There are some basic things you can do to help make this first impression in marketplace great!

- **Be found:** Write your offer description using key words and terms your buyer will search for. 
- **Be visual:** Images and videos help show users your key features and can help illustrate your experience. Think about what you can show that helps deliver your value proposition or answer your buyer's top questions.
- **Provide an experience:** Customers like to try before they buy. Leads generated from demos, trials, and test drives prove to lead to more customer deals. The stronger the trial experience you can provide the stronger the lead you'll generate. We've found that test drive leads result (on average) to 40% closed deals.
- **Help your audience learn:** While we'd encourage you to keep your Overview space clear and simple, there's also plenty of room to point to additional resources about your product. Use this space to deliver the concise message about what your product does and how it's a fit for your customer's needs; don't be afraid to direct them to additional materials to learn more. Bonus if these learning materials or links can track into your content marketing strategy so you can be consistently nurturing leads.
- **Leverage ratings & reviews:** Let your customers sell your product for you. Customer advocacy can be the biggest driver of sales and is often where buyers go before they learn more about your product. Having multiple strong reviews will also help bump your offer up in search results and into key featured areas.

### Build a Great Landing Page
A landing page on your company website is a gateway from your demand generation activities to your marketplace listing in Azure Marketplace. 

Begin by identifying your goals. For your Marketplace solutions, decide who your target customer is and what action you want them to take. Sample actions would be 'Test Drive our solution,' or 'Get a solution now.' Your landing page can be leveraged across multiple marketing tactics ' anything from events, webcasts, and social media to whitepapers, technical training sessions, and press releases. The more consistent you are in your messaging and call to action, the easier your solution will be to find.

When you have a campaign plan ready, follow these best practices and consider what to avoid when building the page to maximize the effectiveness of your landing page: 


|Best Practice  |Things to Avoid  |
|---------|---------|
|**Articulate what customer problem your solution solves, and how you leverage Azure to make it happen**    |  Failing to articulate the ways in which your solution plus Azure work together       |
|**Create a short, easy-to-remember URL**    |    Long URLs aren't memorable and are hard to locate     |
|**Add relevant visual content: a customer testimonial video or solution architecture are best practices**   |   Using too much text can make your audience tune out and stop exploring with you      |
|**Create a clear call to action to direct visitors to your Marketplace catalog page**    |   Having too many links or possible actions on the page       |
|**Put your call to action in a header or clearly delineated section**    |  Embedding the links to your Marketplace listing in a paragraph of text       |
|**Research best keywords and optimize the page for search**    | Assuming your product name will generate higher search rankings        |
|**Leverage keywords from your advertising campaigns**    |  Using many different keywords across your web properties will dilute your advertising investments       |
|**Put relevant product names and keywords 'above the fold'**     | Making users scroll to see what product or solution you are showcasing        |
|**Use brand imagery (such as Azure Certified*) to validate your solution, and in accordance with Microsoft branding guidelines**    |    Using un-approved Microsoft brand imagery     |

### Promoting your New Offer

#### Building an Effective Marketing Campaign
A marketing campaign is a series of promotional activities or marketing tactics aimed at driving your audience to a desired action or outcome. Before designing your campaign, you should:

#### Know Your Audience

First, verify who is the buyer and who is the influencer? Your tactics and calls to action for each group may differ. Ask these evaluation questions:

- How much control does the buyer have over the purchasing decision? 
- How much influence does the influencer have? 
- What does the influencer influence? 
- Do they influence budget or which solution is picked? 

Knowing the answers to these questions will help you make decisions about where to invest your dollars and how to distribute your dollars.

#### Define where Your Audience Learns

Buyers are 90% of the way through their journey by the time they visit a marketplace. Buyers get this far along in the decision-making process by learning about solutions and assessing options in advance. You want to design a campaign that aims to be where your buyers and influencers learn. Every audience for each industry, vertical, or category is different. Does your audience learn online, through email, at trade shows, through social media, or through conversations with trusted advisors? Depending on where and how your audience learns you'll want to design activities and distribute your marketing dollars accordingly. The combination of these tactics becomes your campaign strategy.

#### Create Clear Campaign Goals

You'll need to define success for your marketplace campaign and create clear KPIs. You may run multiple campaigns with different end goals. Of course, we all want to grow sales. The ultimate end-goal is increased revenue or customer acquisition. However, your marketing campaigns may be tied to goals at other stages of the buying cycle.

For instance, if you have newly launched your product in our Marketplace you may find your focus is best spent on audience education and lead generation. Success might be defined by the number of leads generated from your marketplace listing. In this case your marketing tactics (and landing page) would focus on drawing customers to your marketplace listing.

If you have a trial set up in marketplace and you know that your product requires some level of engagement and experience before purchase, you may make your campaign goal the number of trials downloaded. In this case, the CTA for your campaign tactics would focus sharply on encouraging a trial in marketplace. 

If your product or category is more well-known and you have purchase capabilities set up in marketplace you may decide to skip the trial step and direct your audience directly to your 'buy now' link in marketplace.

At a more mature point in your offer's history you may decide to focus your campaign efforts on upselling your customer base and in this case drive action toward increased purchase in Marketplace. Your tactics would focus on encouraging customers to 'buy now' in marketplace. Your KPI might be the revenue generated through Marketplace.

Whatever your offer's maturity and the goals of your organization, staying focused on this goal and mapping out a set of integrated marketing tactics aligned to this goal is key to maximizing your campaign effectiveness.

As part of being a new publisher in the Azure Marketplace, we'll offer you some free Marketplace GTM benefits. You should think critically about how to leverage these benefits in your campaign strategy. Let our marketing team know your marketplace campaign goals and your desired audience action. We can customize these deliverables to work into your plan.

For additional go-to-market support including templates, web content, training, and tools to promote your business visit [www.MicrosoftGoToMarket.com](https://www.MicrosoftGoToMarket.com) For additional content on campaign building and marketing best practices, visit [Smart Partner Marketing](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/smart-partner-marketing), a program of the Microsoft Partner Network.

#### Marketplace GTM Benefits

New listings in Marketplace will become eligible to receive free Marketplace GTM Benefits. Once listed, our team of marketing specialists will reach out to you to kick-start these activities. There is nothing for you to do except to engage with us once we reach out. 

The activities we provide differ depending on your solution status in our marketplace. Benefits significantly increase for offers that come with a trial experience or transact capabilities within marketplace.

To maximize the impact of these activities, we'd encourage you to have your launch plan ready to execute. You may want to leverage your landing page for many of these tactics. Note that OCP Catalog (One Commercial Partner Catalog) is a benefit of members in the Microsoft Partner Network. 

![Marketplace GTM Benefits](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/marketplace-gtm-promotion.png)

For support including templates, web content, training, and tools to promote your business, visit [Microsoft Go To Market](https://www.microsoftgotomarket.com).

#### Enable Lead Sharing

Ensure that lead management is enabled in your Marketplace offer so that you receive the contact information of your Marketplace customers. These leads provide the basis for outreach for demand generation campaigns, sales motions by your field sales staff, and information about how your offer is performing. 

Best practices for using these leads include:

- Qualifying the leads and scoring them as sales opportunities
- Nurturing them to enter a sales pipeline
- Align these efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy

These leads demonstrate very targeted user interest in your Marketplace offer and in your technology, and so should be treated as a way to find potentially highly engaged customers. When a lead is created in Marketplace, a similar lead is created in the Microsoft field seller CRM. 

However, Marketplace leads are different from Microsoft seller-qualified leads that are a feature of the Co-Selling program. See below to learn about how to access the Co-Sell program. 

#### Promote Your Business Through Microsoft

There are many people and teams within Microsoft whose sole goal is to support our partners and reduce any friction you have in selling with us. Now that you've listed in our marketplace you've opened access to our marketplace programs and resources. 

If you haven't already signed up to the [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com), this should be your first step. MPN offers guidance for navigating Microsoft ' from new business opportunities, connecting with teams or partners, to information about solutions and training to help grow your skillset.
The best next steps you can take to open access to even more partner benefits and resources are:

1.	Leverage your [Core Benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/membership/core-benefits)
    As part of our Microsoft Partner Network, you receive a set of core benefits that can help you save time and money while you strengthen your capabilities, better serve customers, and build connections to reach your full business potential.

2.	Earn your [Cloud Platform Competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/cloud-platform-competency)
    Earning a competency allows you to differentiate yourself within Microsoft's expansive partner network as well as demonstrate technical expertise and customer success in market. Earning a competency is also a prerequisite for many key partner programs like Co-Sell.

3.	Become [Co-Sell Ready](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/reach-customers/promote-your-business)
    This program allows you to collaborate directly with Microsoft sellers and other partners on target customer opportunities and account planning. Your solution becomes visible to our sellers in their solution catalog and our sellers are rewarded for collaborating and winning with you.

#### Merchandising 
As part of the publishing process, you considered what type of offer to create and had the opportunity to choose a category for your offer in Azure Marketplace. Make sure you select a category that is accurate for your solution so that it will appear accurately to potential customers. 

In Azure Marketplace, you become eligible for featured apps when you enable Trial and Transact functionality. Review Marketplace GTM Benefits to understand how Featured Apps fits in the context of your Go-To-Market benefits. 

Featured apps are chosen based on which apps provide the best customer experience for a user and leverages high quality partner marketing engagement. This includes clarity of the listing, reliability of the technology, and growth of customers platform usage, and your level of engagement with creating high quality marketing material. 

To maximize your app's chances of being featured, you should invest in the success of your marketplace offering and consider the following approaches to ensure a great customer experience of your offer: 

- Ensure your marketing artifacts are uploaded and displaying correctly
- Join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership) and engage with the partner ecosystem
- Drive high quality traffic to your offer in Azure Marketplace by creating high quality demand generation campaigns
- Ensure that all your Azure solutions and apps are available in Azure Marketplace
- Grow the consumption of your Azure Marketplace offers by driving demand, providing high quality customer service, and providing timely updates on your product

- Summary snapshot of orders
- Usage
- Deployments
- Customer trends on the Insights home page
- Detailed orders, usage, and customer data
- Orders and usage shown as a monthly summary or as a six-month trend view
- Usage/orders sliced by several criteria

Detailed reports show customer information, like company name and geographic location down to the postal code, so you can compare your customers and compensate your sellers. The following list includes the specific attributes we provide about your customers:
- Reseller
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Company Name
- Transaction Date
- Subscription Name
- Azure Subscription Id (PAYG customers only)

## Guidelines and How-Tos

### Guidelines for creating a Microsoft Id to manage an Azure Marketplace Account

When creating a company account, follow these guidelines if more than one person will need to access the account by logging in with the Microsoft account that opened the account.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Allow multiple users to access your Dev Center account, we recommend using Azure Active Directory to assign roles to individual users, who can access the account by signing in with their individual Azure AD credentials. For more info, please review the [Guidance with AAD Federated Domains](#guidance-with-aad-federated-domains).Create your Microsoft account using an email address that belongs to your company's domain, but not to a single individual'for example, windowsapps@fabrikam.com.

- Limit access to this Microsoft account to the smallest possible number of developers.
- Set up a corporate email distribution list that includes everyone who needs to access the developer account, and add this email address to your security info. This allows all the employees on the list to receive security codes when needed and to manage your Microsoft account's security info. If setting up a distribution list is not feasible, the owner of the individual email account will need to be available to access and share the security code when prompted (such as when new security info is added to the account or when it must be accessed from a new device).
- Add a company phone number that does not require an extension and is accessible to key team members.
- In general, have developers use trusted devices to log in to your company's developer account. All key team members should have access to these trusted devices. This will reduce the need for security codes to be sent when accessing the account.
- If you need to allow access to the account from a non-trusted PC, limit that access to a maximum of five developers. Ideally, these developers should access the account from machines that share the same geographical and network location.
- Frequently review your company's security info at [https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage](https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage) to make sure it's all current.

Your developer account should be accessed primarily from trusted PCs. This is critical because there is a limit to the number of codes generated per account, per week. It also enables the most seamless sign-in experience.
For more information on additional developer account guidelines and security, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account).

### Guidance for Microsoft IDs in AAD Federated Domain

Your corporate account may be federated using [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/), and it will return an error if you try to create a Microsoft ID with a corporate email address. If you get an error, first check with your IT team to make sure this is the case. This is a known issue, and we are working on resolving it. 
The workaround is the following:

We recommend you create a new email address in the **@outlook.com** domain. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://signup.live.com/signup](https://signup.live.com/signup) and select **Get a new email address**


2. Create the new email address and enter a password. This will create both a new Microsoft ID and an email mailbox in the outlook.com service. Continue the registration process until the account is created.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Ensure that the email id or distribution list (a distribution list is recommended to remove dependency from individuals) which you will be using for registering in the Dev Center is at first registered as a Microsoft account. If not, then please register using this [link](https://signup.live.com/signup?uaid=e479342fe2824efeb0c3d92c8f961fd3&lic=1).

Also, **any email id under the Microsoft company domain** cannot be used for
Dev Center registration.

Once the Microsoft ID is created with this account, log in to the account [mailbox](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) and create an email forward rule to move all the emails on this mailbox to the email address you created in your domain to manage the Azure Marketplace account. Refer to this [link](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-rules-in-Outlook-Web-App-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed) on how to create an email forward rule in outlook.com.

After this last step is completed, you will have all emails/communications from the Microsoft ID sent to your email account in your domain. You will need to use the @outlook.com email address to authenticate in both in the Microsoft Developer Center and the Cloud Partner Portal.

### Instructions on how to register in the Development Center

1. Open a new Internet Explorer InPrivate or Chrome Incognito browsing session to ensure that you're not signed in to a personal account.
2. Go to [http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure](http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure) to register yourself as a seller in the Dev Center. Please read the following important note before you proceed.

   ![Dev Center Email](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/registerdevcenteremail.png)

3. Complete the "Help us protect your account" wizard, which will verify your identity via phone number or email address.
4. In the "Registration-Account Info" section, select your **Account country/region** from the dropdown menu.

   ![Account Info](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationaccountinfo.png)
   
   >[!WARNING]
   >"Sell-from" Countries: To sell your services on the Azure Marketplace, your registered entity needs to be from one of the approved 'sell-from' countries above. This restriction is for payout and taxation reasons. For more information, see the [Marketplace participation policies]https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/.

5. Select your "Account Type" as **Company** and then click the **Next** button.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >To better understand account types and which is best for you to choose, please view page [Account types, locations, and fees](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/account-types-locations-and-fees).

6. Enter the **Publisher display name**, typically the name of your company.

   >[!TIP]
   >The publisher display name entered in the Dev Center is not displayed in the Azure Marketplace once your offer goes listed. But this must be filled to complete the registration process.

7. Enter the **Contact info** for the account verification.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >You must provide accurate contact information because it will be used in our verification process for your company to be approved in the Developer Center.

8. Enter the contact information for the **Company Approver**. Company approver is the person who can verify that you are authorized to create an account in the Dev Center on behalf of your organization. Click on **Next** to move to the **"Payment section"** once you are finished.

   ![Dev Center Payment](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationpayment.png)

9. Enter your payment info to pay for your account. If you have a promo code that covers the cost of registration, you can enter that here. Otherwise, provide your credit card info, or PayPal in supported markets. When you are finished, click **Next** to move on to the **"Review screen."**

   ![Dev Center Payment](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationpayment2.png)

10. Review your account info and confirm that everything is correct. Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement. Check the box to indicate you have read and accepted these terms.
11. Click **Finish** to confirm your registration. We'll send a confirmation message to your email address.
12. If you are planning to publish only free offers, click **Go to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com)**.

If you are planning to publish commercial (TRANSACT) offers--e.g., Virtual Machine offers with hourly billing model-- click **Update your account information** where you must fill in the tax and banking information in your Developer Center account.

If you prefer to update your tax and bank information later, then you can move to the next section. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In case of commercial (TRANSACT) offers, you will not be able to push your offers to production without completing the tax and bank account information.

#### Add tax and banking information

If you want to publish commercial offers for purchase, you also need to add payout and tax information and submit it for validation in the Developer Center. If you will publish only free or BYOL offers, then you do not need to add this information. You can add it later, but it takes some time to validate the tax information. If you know that you will offer commercial offers for purchase, we recommend that you add it as soon as possible.

**Bank Information**
1. Sign in to the Microsoft Developer Center with your Microsoft account.
2.  Click **Payout account** in the left menu, under **Choose payment method** click **Bank account** or **PayPal**.

   >    [!IMPORTANT]
   >    If you have commercial offers that customers purchase in the Marketplace, this is the account where you will receive payout for those purchases.

3. Enter the payment info, and click Save when you are satisfied.

   >    [!IMPORTANT]
   >    If you need to update or change your payout account, follow the same steps above, replacing the current info with the new info. Changing your payout account can delay your payments by up to one payment cycle. This delay occurs because we need to verify the account change, just as we did when you first set up the payout account. You'll still get paid for the full amount after your account has been verified; any payments due for the current payment cycle will be added to the next one.
