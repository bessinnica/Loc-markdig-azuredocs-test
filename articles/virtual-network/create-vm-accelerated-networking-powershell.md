# Create a Windows virtual machine with Accelerated Networking

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Virtual machines must be created with Accelerated Networking enabled. This feature cannot be enabled on existing virtual machines. You can follow the steps below to enable accelerated networking
>   1. Delete the virtual machine
>   2. Recreate the virtual machine with accelerated networking enabled

In this tutorial, you learn how to create a Windows virtual machine (VM) with Accelerated Networking. Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the datapath, reducing latency, jitter, and CPU utilization, for use with the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types. The following picture shows communication between two VMs with and without accelerated networking:

Without accelerated networking, all networking traffic in and out of the VM must traverse the host and the virtual switch. The virtual switch provides all policy enforcement, such as network security groups, access control lists, isolation, and other network virtualized services to network traffic. To learn more about virtual switches, read the [Hyper-V network virtualization and virtual switch](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj945275.aspx) article.

With accelerated networking, network traffic arrives at the VM's network interface (NIC), and is then forwarded to the VM. All network policies that the virtual switch applies are now offloaded and applied in hardware. Applying policy in hardware enables the NIC to forward network traffic directly to the VM, bypassing the host and the virtual switch, while maintaining all the policy it applied in the host.

The benefits of accelerated networking only apply to the VM that it is enabled on. For the best results, it is ideal to enable this feature on at least two VMs connected to the same Azure Virtual Network (VNet). When communicating across VNets or connecting on-premises, this feature has minimal impact to overall latency.

## Benefits
* **Lower Latency / Higher packets per second (pps):** Removing the virtual switch from the datapath removes the time packets spend in the host for policy processing and increases the number of packets that can be processed inside the VM.
* **Reduced jitter:** Virtual switch processing depends on the amount of policy that needs to be applied and the workload of the CPU that is doing the processing. Offloading the policy enforcement to the hardware removes that variability by delivering packets directly to the VM, removing the host to VM communication and all software interrupts and context switches.
* **Decreased CPU utilization:** Bypassing the virtual switch in the host leads to less CPU utilization for processing network traffic.

## Supported operating systems
Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter and Windows Server 2016.

## Supported VM instances
Accelerated Networking is supported on most general purpose and compute-optimized instance sizes with 4 or more vCPUs. On instances such as D/DSv3 or E/ESv3 that support hyperthreading, Accelerated Networking is supported on VM instances with 8 or more vCPUs. Supported series are: D/DSv2, D/DSv3, E/ESv3, F/Fs/Fsv2, and Ms/Mms.

For more information on VM instances, see [Windows VM sizes](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

## Regions
Available in all public Azure regions and Azure Government Cloud. 

## Limitations
The following limitations exist when using this capability:

* **Network interface creation:** Accelerated networking can only be enabled for a new NIC. It cannot be enabled for an existing NIC.
* **VM creation:** A NIC with accelerated networking enabled can only be attached to a VM when the VM is created. The NIC cannot be attached to an existing VM. If adding the VM to an existing availability set, all VMs in the availability set must also have accelerated networking enabled.
* **Deployment through Azure Resource Manager only:** Virtual machines (classic) cannot be deployed with Accelerated Networking.

## Create a virtual network

Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps) version 5.1.1 or later. To find your currently installed version, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM`. If you need to install or upgrade, install the latest version of the AzureRM module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM). In a PowerShell session, log in to an Azure account using [Add-AzureRmAccount](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Profile/Add-AzureRmAccount).

In the following examples, replace example parameter names with your own values. Example parameter names included *myResourceGroup*, *myNic*, and *myVM*.

Create a resource group with [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Resources/New-AzureRmResourceGroup). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *centralus* location:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "centralus"
```

First, create a subnet configuration with [New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig). The following example creates a subnet named *mySubnet*:

```powershell
$subnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
    -Name "mySubnet" `
    -AddressPrefix "192.168.1.0/24"
```

Create a virtual network with [New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork), with the *mySubnet* subnet.

```powershell
$vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Location "centralus" `
    -Name "myVnet" `
    -AddressPrefix "192.168.0.0/16" `
    -Subnet $Subnet
```

## Create a network security group

First, create a network security group rule with [New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig).

```powershell
$rdp = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
    -Name 'Allow-RDP-All' `
    -Description 'Allow RDP' `
    -Access Allow `
    -Protocol Tcp `
    -Direction Inbound `
    -Priority 100 `
    -SourceAddressPrefix * `
    -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
    -DestinationPortRange 3389
```

Create a network security group with [New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup) and assign the *Allow-RDP-All* security rule to it. In addition to the *Allow-RDP-All* rule, the network security group contains several default rules. One default rule disables all inbound access from the Internet, which is why the *Allow-RDP-All* rule is assigned to the network security group so that you can remotely connect to the virtual machine, once it's created.

```powershell
$nsg = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup `
    -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
    -Location centralus `
    -Name "myNsg" `
    -SecurityRules $rdp
```

Associate the network security group to the *mySubnet* subnet with [Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig). The rule in the network security group is effective for all resources deployed in the subnet.

```powershell
Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
    -VirtualNetwork $vnet `
    -Name 'mySubnet' `
    -AddressPrefix "192.168.1.0/24" `
    -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
```

## Create a network interface with accelerated networking
Create a public IP address with [New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress). A public IP address isn't required if you don't plan to access the virtual machine from the Internet, but to complete the steps in this article, it is required.

```powershell
$publicIp = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress `
    -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
    -Name 'myPublicIp' `
    -location centralus `
    -AllocationMethod Dynamic
```

Create a network interface with [New-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Network/New-AzureRmNetworkInterface) with accelerated networking enabled and assign the public IP address to the network interface. The following example creates a network interface named *myNic* in the *mySubnet* subnet of the *myVnet* virtual network and assigns the *myPublicIp* public IP address to it:

```powershell
$nic = New-AzureRmNetworkInterface `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myNic" `
    -Location "centralus" `
    -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id `
    -PublicIpAddressId $publicIp.Id `
    -EnableAcceleratedNetworking
```

## Create the virtual machine

Set your VM credentials to the `$cred` variable using [Get-Credential](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential):

```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential
```

First, define your VM with [New-AzureRmVMConfig](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvmconfig). The following example defines a VM named *myVM* with a VM size that supports Accelerated Networking (*Standard_DS4_v2*):

```powershell
$vmConfig = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName "myVm" -VMSize "Standard_DS4_v2"
```

For a list of all VM sizes and characteristics, see [Windows VM sizes](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

Create the rest of your VM configuration with [Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/set-azurermvmoperatingsystem) and [Set-AzureRmVMSourceImage](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/set-azurermvmsourceimage). The following example creates a Windows Server 2016 VM:

```powershell
$vmConfig = Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig `
    -Windows `
    -ComputerName "myVM" `
    -Credential $cred `
    -ProvisionVMAgent `
    -EnableAutoUpdate
$vmConfig = Set-AzureRmVMSourceImage -VM $vmConfig `
    -PublisherName "MicrosoftWindowsServer" `
    -Offer "WindowsServer" `
    -Skus "2016-Datacenter" `
    -Version "latest"
```

Attach the network interface that you previously created with [Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/add-azurermvmnetworkinterface):

```powershell
$vmConfig = Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $nic.Id
```

Finally, create your VM with [New-AzureRmVM](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvm):

```powershell
New-AzureRmVM -VM $vmConfig -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "centralus"
```

## Confirm the driver is installed in the operating system

Once you create the VM in Azure, connect to the VM and confirm that the driver is installed in Windows. 

1. From an Internet browser, open the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure account.
2. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *myVm*. When **myVm** appears in the search results, click it. If **Creating** is visible under the **Connect** button, Azure has not yet finished creating the VM. Click **Connect** in the top left corner of the overview only after you no longer see **Creating** under the **Connect** button.
3. Enter the username and password you entered in [Create the virtual machine](#create-the-virtual-machine). If you've never connected to a Windows VM in Azure, see [Connect to virtual machine](../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#connect-to-virtual-machine).
4. Right-click the Windows Start button and click **Device Manager**. Expand the **Network adapters** node. Confirm that the **Mellanox ConnectX-3 Virtual Function Ethernet Adapter** appears, as shown in the following picture:
   
    ![Device Manager](./media/create-vm-accelerated-networking/device-manager.png)

Accelerated Networking is now enabled for your VM.
