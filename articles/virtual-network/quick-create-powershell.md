# Create a virtual network using PowerShell

In this article, you learn how to create a virtual network. After creating a virtual network, you deploy two virtual machines into the virtual network and communicate privately between them.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.1.1 or later. To find the installed version, run ` Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM`. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Login-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Resources/New-AzureRmResourceGroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location. All Azure resources are created within an Azure location (or region).

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location EastUS
```

## Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network with [New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/new-azurermvirtualnetwork). The following example creates a default virtual network named *myVirtualNetwork* in the *EastUS* location:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$virtualNetwork = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location EastUS `
  -Name myVirtualNetwork `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
```

All virtual networks have one or more address prefixes assigned to them. The address space is specified in CIDR notation. The address space 10.0.0.0/24 encompasses 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.254. Virtual networks have zero or more subnets within them. Resources are deployed into a subnet in a virtual network. 

Create a subnet configuration with [New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/new-azurermvirtualnetworksubnetconfig). All subnets have an address prefix that exists within the virtual network's address prefix. In this example, a subnet configuration with the same address prefix as the virtual network's address prefix is created:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$subnetConfig = Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name default `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24 `
  -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork
```

Though the subnet address prefix encompasses 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.254, only the addresses 10.0.0.4-10.0.0.254 are available, because Azure reserves the first four addresses (0-3) and the last address in each subnet. Since the subnet address prefix is the same as the virtual network address prefix, only one subnet can exist in this virtual network.

Write the subnet configuration to the virtual network with [Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork), which creates the subnet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$virtualNetwork | Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork
```

## Create virtual machines

A virtual network enables several types of Azure resources to communicate privately with each other. One type of resource you can deploy into a virtual network is a virtual machine. Create two virtual machines in the virtual network so you can validate and understand how communication between virtual machines in a virtual network works in a later step.

Create a virtual machine with [New-AzureRmVM](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvm). When running this step, you are prompted for credentials. The values that you enter are configured as the user name and password for the virtual machine. The location that a virtual machine is created in must be the same location the virtual network exists in. The virtual machine isn't required to be in the same resource group as the virtual machine, though it is in this article. The `-AsJob` parameter allows the command to run in the background so you can continue with the next task.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myVirtualNetwork" `
    -SubnetName "default" `
    -Name "myVm1" `
    -AsJob
```

Output similar to the following example output is returned, and Azure starts creating the virtual machine in the background.

```powershell
Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command                  
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------                  
1      Long Running... AzureLongRun... Running       True            localhost            New-AzureRmVM     
```

Azure DHCP automatically assigns 10.0.0.4 to the virtual machine during creation, because it is the first available address in the *default* subnet.

Create a second virtual machine. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVm `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VirtualNetworkName "myVirtualNetwork" `
  -SubnetName "default" `
  -Name "myVm2"
```
The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. Once created, Azure returns output about the created virtual machine. Though not in the returned output, Azure assigned *10.0.0.5* to the *myVm2* virtual machine, because it was the next available address in the subnet.

## Connect to a virtual machine

Use the [Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermpublicipaddress) command to return the public IP address of a virtual machine. Azure assigns a public, Internet routable IP address to each virtual machine, by default. The public IP address is assigned to the virtual machine from a [pool of addresses assigned to each Azure region](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653). While Azure knows which public IP address is assigned to a virtual machine, the operating system running in a virtual machine has no awareness of any public IP address assigned to it. The following example returns the public IP address of the *myVm1* virtual machine:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name myVm1 -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup | Select IpAddress
```

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the *myVm1* virtual machine from your local computer. Replace `<publicIpAddress>` with the IP address returned from the previous command.

```
mstsc /v:<publicIpAddress>
```

A Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) file is created, downloaded to your computer, and opened. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the virtual machine, and then click **OK**. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or **Continue** to proceed with the connection.

## Validate communication

Attempting to ping a Windows virtual machine fails, because ping is not allowed through the Windows firewall, by default. To allow ping to *myVm1*, enter the following command from a command prompt:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=Allow-ping protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
```

To validate communication with *myVm2*, enter the following command from a command prompt on the *myVm1* virtual machine. Provide the credentials you used when you created the virtual machine, and then complete the connection:

```
mstsc /v:myVm2
```

The remote desktop connection is successful because both virtual machines have private IP addresses assigned from the *default* subnet and because remote desktop is open through the Windows firewall, by default. You are able to connect to *myVm2* by hostname because Azure automatically provides DNS name resolution for all hosts within a virtual network. From a commmand prompt, ping my *myVm1*, from *myVm2*.

```
ping myvm1
```

Ping is successful because you allowed it through the Windows firewall on the *myVm1* virtual machine in a previous step. To confirm outbound communication to the Internet, enter the following command:

```
ping bing.com
```

You receive four replies from bing.com. By default, any virtual machine in a virtual network can communicate outbound to the Internet.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains. Exit the remote desktop session, then run the following command from your computer to delete the resource group:

```azurepowershell-interactive 
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

## Next steps

In this article, you deployed a default virtual network with one subnet and two virtual machines.
