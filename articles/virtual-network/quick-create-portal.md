# Create a virtual network using the Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to create a virtual network. After creating a virtual network, you deploy two virtual machines into the virtual network and communicate privately between them.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com.

## Create a virtual network

1. Click **+ New** on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

2. Select **Networking**, and then select **Virtual network**.

3. As shown in the following picture, enter *myVirtualNetwork* for **Name**, *myResourceGroup* for **Resource group**, select a **Location** and your **Subscription**, accept the remaining defaults, and then click **Create**.

    The **Address space** is specified in CIDR notation. A virtual network contains zero or more subnets. The default subnet **Address range** of 10.0.0.0/24 uses the entire address range of the virtual network, so another subnet cannot be created within the virtual network using the default address space and range. The specified address range includes the IP addresses 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.254. Only 10.0.0.4-10.0.0.254 are available however, because Azure reserves the first four addresses (0-3) and the last address in each subnet. The available IP addresses are assigned to resources deployed within a virtual network.

## Create virtual machines

A virtual network enables several types of Azure resources to communicate privately with each other. One type of resource you can deploy into a virtual network is a virtual machine. Create two virtual machines in the virtual network so you can validate and understand how communication between virtual machines in a virtual network works in a later step.

1. Click the **New** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

2. Select **Compute**, and then select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.

3. Enter virtual machine information shown in the picture that follows. The **User name** and **Password** you enter are used to log in to the virtual machine in a later step. The password must be at least 12 characters long and meet the [defined complexity requirements](../virtual-machines/windows/faq.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm). Select your **Subscription**, choose to use the existing *myResourceGroup* resource group, and ensure that the **Location** selected is the same location you created the virtual network in. When complete, click **OK**.

    ![Enter basic information about a virtual machine](./media/quick-create-portal/virtual-machine-basics.png)

4. Select a size for the virtual machine and then click **Select**. To see more sizes, select **View all** or change the **Supported disk type** filter. The sizes that appear for you may be different than the following example: 

    ![Select a size for a virtual machine](./media/quick-create-portal/virtual-machine-size.png)

5. Under **Settings**, *myVirtualNetwork* should already be selected for **Virtual network**, but if it's not, click **Virtual network**, then select *myVirtualNetwork*. Leave *default* selected for **Subnet**, and then click **OK**.

    ![Select a virtual network](./media/quick-create-portal/virtual-machine-network-settings.png)

6. On the **Summary** page, click **Create** to start the virtual machine deployment. 

7. The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. After creation, the virtual machine is pinned to the Azure portal dashboard and the virtual machine summary automatically opens. Click **Networking**.

    ![Virtual machine networking information](./media/quick-create-portal/virtual-machine-networking.png)

    You see that the **Private IP** address is *10.0.0.4*. In step 5, under **Settings**, you selected the *myVirtualNetwork* virtual network and accepted the subnet named *default* for **Subnet**. When you [created the virtual network](#create-a-virtual-network), you accepted the default value of 10.0.0.0/24 for the subnet **Address range**. Azure's DHCP server assigns the first available address for the subnet you select to the virtual machine. Since Azure reserves the first four addresses (0-3) of each subnet, 10.0.0.4 is the first available IP address available for the subnet.

    The **Public IP** address assigned is different than the address assigned to your virtual machine. Azure assigns a public, Internet routable IP address to each virtual machine, by default. The public IP address is assigned to the virtual machine from a [pool of addresses assigned to each Azure region](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653). While Azure knows which public IP address is assigned to a virtual machine, the operating system running in a virtual machine has no awareness of any public IP address assigned to it.

8. Complete steps 1-7 again, but in step 3, name the virtual machine *myVm2*. 

9. After the virtual machine is created, click **Networking**, as you did in step 7. You see the **Private IP** address is *10.0.0.5*. Since Azure previously assigned the first usable address of *10.0.0.4* in the subnet to the *myVm1* virtual machine, it assigned *10.0.0.5* to the *myVm2* virtual machine, because it was the next available address in the subnet.

## Connect to a virtual machine

1. Remotely connect to the *myVm1* virtual machine. At the top of the Azure portal, enter *myVm1*. When **myVm1** appears in the search results, click it. Click the **Connect** button.

    ![Virtual machine overview](./media/quick-create-portal/virtual-machine-overview.png)


2. After clicking the **Connect** button, a Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) file is created and downloaded to your computer.  
3. Open the downloaded rdp file. If prompted, click **Connect**. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the virtual machine, and then click **OK**. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or **Continue** to proceed with the connection.

## Validate communication

Attempting to ping a Windows virtual machine fails, because ping is not allowed through the Windows firewall, by default. To allow ping to *myVm1*, enter the following command from a command prompt:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=Allow-ping protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
```

To validate communication with *myVm2*, enter the following command from a command prompt on the *myVm1* virtual machine. Provide the credentials you used when you created the virtual machine, and then complete the connection:

```
mstsc /v:myVm2
```

The remote desktop connection is successful because both virtual machines have private IP addresses assigned from the *default* subnet and because remote desktop is open through the Windows firewall, by default. You are able to connect to *myVm2* by hostname because Azure automatically provides DNS name resolution for all hosts within a virtual network. From a command prompt, ping my *myVm1*, from *myVm2*.

```
ping myvm1
```

Ping is successful because you allowed it through the Windows firewall on the *myVm1* virtual machine in a previous step. To confirm outbound communication to the Internet, enter the following command:

```
ping bing.com
```

You receive four replies from bing.com. By default, any virtual machine in a virtual network can communicate outbound to the Internet.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, and all its contents. At the top of the Azure portal, enter *myResourceGroup*. When **myResourceGroup** appears in the search results, click it. Click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this article, you deployed a default virtual network with one subnet and two virtual machines. To learn how to create a custom virtual network with multiple subnets and perform basic management tasks, continue to the tutorial for creating a custom virtual network and managing it.
