# Logic Apps Loops, Scopes, and Debatching
  
Logic Apps provides a number of ways to work with arrays, collections, batches, and loops within a workflow.
  
## ForEach loop and arrays
  
Logic Apps allows you to loop over a set of data and perform an action for each item.  Looping over a collection is possible via the `foreach` action.  In the designer, you can add a for each loop.  After selecting the array you wish to iterate over, you can begin adding actions.  You may add multiple actions per foreach loop.  Once within the loop, you can begin to specify what should occur at each value of the array.

  This example sends an email for each email address that contains 'microsoft.com'. If using code-view, you can specify a for each loop like the following example:

``` json
{
    "email_filter": {
        "type": "query",
        "inputs": {
            "from": "@triggerBody()['emails']",
            "where": "@contains(item()['email'], 'microsoft.com')"
        }
    },
    "forEach_email": {
        "type": "foreach",
        "foreach": "@body('email_filter')",
        "actions": {
            "send_email": {
                "type": "ApiConnection",
                "inputs": {
                "body": {
                    "to": "@item()",
                    "from": "me@contoso.com",
                    "message": "Hello, thank you for ordering"
                },
                "host": {
                    "connection": {
                        "id": "@parameters('$connections')['office365']['connection']['id']"
                    }
                },
                }
            }
        },
        "runAfter":{
            "email_filter": [ "Succeeded" ]
        }
    }
}
```
  
  A `foreach` action can iterate over arrays with thousands of entities.  Iterations execute in parallel by default.  See [Limits and configuration](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md) for details on array and concurrency limits.

### Sequential ForEach loops

To enable a foreach loop to execute sequentially, the `Sequential` operation option should be added.

``` json
"forEach_email": {
        "type": "foreach",
        "foreach": "@body('email_filter')",
        "operationOptions": "Sequential",
        "..."
}
```
  
## Until loop
  
  You can perform an action or series of actions until a condition is met.  The most common scenario for using an until loop is calling an endpoint until you get the response you are looking for.  In the designer, you can specify to add an until loop.  After adding actions inside the loop, you can set the exit condition, as well as the loop limits.
  
  This example calls an HTTP endpoint until the response body has the value 'Completed'.  It completes when either: 
  
  * HTTP Response has status of 'Completed'
  * It has tried for one hour
  * It has looped 100 times
  
  If using code-view, you can specify an until loop like the following example:
  
  ``` json
  {
      "until_successful":{
        "type": "until",
        "expression": "@equals(actions('http')['status'], 'Completed')",
        "limit": {
            "count": 100,
            "timeout": "PT1H"
        },
        "actions": {
            "create_resource": {
                "type": "http",
                "inputs": {
                    "url": "http://provisionRseource.com",
                    "body": {
                        "resourceId": "@triggerBody()"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
      }
  }
  ```
  
## SplitOn and debatching

Sometimes a trigger may receive an array of items that you want to debatch and start a workflow per item.  This debatching can be accomplished via the `spliton` command.  By default, if your trigger swagger specifies a payload that is an array, a `spliton` is added. The `spliton` command starts a run per item in the array.  SplitOn can only be added to a trigger which can be manually configured or overridden. You cannot have a `spliton` and also implement the synchronous response pattern.  Any workflow called that has a `response` action in addition to `spliton` runs asynchronously and sends an immediate `202 Accepted` response.  

  This example receives an array of items and debatches on each row. SplitOn can be specified in code-view as the following example:

```
{
    "myDebatchTrigger": {
        "type": "Http",
        "inputs": {
            "url": "http://getNewCustomers",
        },
        "recurrence": {
            "frequencey": "Second",
            "interval": 15
        },
        "spliton": "@triggerBody()['rows']"
    }
}
```

## Scopes

It is possible to group a series of actions together using a scope.  Scopes are useful for implementing exception handling.  In the designer you can add a new scope, and begin adding any actions inside of it.  You can define scopes in code-view like the following example:


```
{
    "myScope": {
        "type": "scope",
        "actions": {
            "call_bing": {
                "type": "http",
                "inputs": {
                    "url": "http://www.bing.com"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
