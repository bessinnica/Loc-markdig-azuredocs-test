# Use direct methods on your IoT device with Python
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-c2d-methods](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-c2d-methods.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you have two Python console apps:

* **CallMethodOnDevice.py**, which calls a method in the simulated device app and displays the response.
* **SimulatedDevice.py**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and responds to the method called by the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both applications to run on devices and your solution back end.
> 

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* [Python 2.x or 3.x][lnk-python-download]. Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system][lnk-install-pip].
* If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package][lnk-visual-c-redist] to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

## Create a simulated device app
In this section, you create a Python console app that responds to a method called by the cloud.

1. Using a text editor, create a new **SimulatedDevice.py** file.

1. Add the following `import` statements and variables at the start of the **SimulatedDevice.py** file:
   
    ```python
    import time
    import sys
    import iothub_client
    from iothub_client import IoTHubClient, IoTHubClientError, IoTHubTransportProvider, IoTHubClientResult, IoTHubError, DeviceMethodReturnValue
    
    WAIT_COUNT = 5
    METHOD_CONTEXT = 0
    METHOD_CALLBACKS = 0

    # chose MQTT or MQTT_WS as transport protocol
    PROTOCOL = IoTHubTransportProvider.MQTT
    CONNECTION_STRING = "<deviceConnectionString>"
    ```

1. Add the following functions to implement the device method callback and direct method on the device:
   
    ```python
    def device_method_callback(method_name, payload, user_context):
        global METHOD_CALLBACKS
	
        if method_name == "DeviceMethod":
            onDeviceMethod()
		
        print ( "\nMethod callback called with:\nmethodName = %s\npayload = %s\ncontext = %s" % (method_name, payload, user_context) )
        METHOD_CALLBACKS += 1
	
        print ( "Total calls confirmed: %d\n" % METHOD_CALLBACKS )
        device_method_return_value = DeviceMethodReturnValue()
        device_method_return_value.response = "{ \"Response\": \"This is the response from the device\" }"
        device_method_return_value.status = 200
	
        return device_method_return_value

    def onDeviceMethod():
        print ( "Direct method called." )
    ```

1. Add the following function to open the connection to your IoT hub and initialize the method listener:
   
    ```python
    def iothub_client_init():
        # prepare iothub client
        client = IoTHubClient(CONNECTION_STRING, PROTOCOL)

        if client.protocol == IoTHubTransportProvider.MQTT or client.protocol == IoTHubTransportProvider.MQTT_WS:
            client.set_device_method_callback(device_method_callback, METHOD_CONTEXT)

        return client
    ```

1. Add the main functions:

    ```python
    def iothub_client_sample_run():
        try:
            client = iothub_client_init()

            while True:
                print ( "IoTHubClient waiting for direct method call, press Ctrl-C to exit" )

                status_counter = 0
                while status_counter <= WAIT_COUNT:
                    time.sleep(10)
                    status_counter += 1
        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "Unexpected error %s from IoTHub" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubClient sample stopped" )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Python direct methods sample..." )
        print ( "    Protocol %s" % PROTOCOL )
        print ( "    Connection string=%s" % CONNECTION_STRING )

        iothub_client_sample_run()
    ```

1. Save and close the **SimulatedDevice.py** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as connection retry), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling][lnk-transient-faults].

## Call a method on a device
In this section, you create a Python console app that calls a method in the simulated device app and then displays the response.


1. Using a text editor, create a new **CallMethodOnDevice.py** file.

1. Add the following `import` statements and variables at the start of the **CallMethodOnDevice.py** file:
   
    ```python
    import sys
    import iothub_service_client
    from iothub_service_client import IoTHubDeviceMethod, IoTHubError

    CONNECTION_STRING = "<IoTHubConnectionString>"
    DEVICE_ID = "<deviceId>"

    METHOD_NAME = "DeviceMethod"
    METHOD_PAYLOAD = "{\"method_number\":\"42\"}"
    TIMEOUT = 60
    ```

1. Add the following functions to implement the device method callback and direct method on the device:
   
    ```python
    def iothub_devicemethod_sample_run():
        try:
            iothub_device_method = IoTHubDeviceMethod(CONNECTION_STRING)

            response = iothub_device_method.invoke(DEVICE_ID, METHOD_NAME, METHOD_PAYLOAD, TIMEOUT)

            print ( "" )
            print ( "Device Method called" )
            print ( "Device Method name       : {0}".format(METHOD_NAME) )
            print ( "Device Method payload    : {0}".format(METHOD_PAYLOAD) )
            print ( "" )
            print ( "Response status          : {0}".format(response.status) )
            print ( "Response payload         : {0}".format(response.payload) )

            try:
                # Try Python 2.xx first
                raw_input("Press Enter to continue...\n")
            except:
                pass
                # Use Python 3.xx in the case of exception
                input("Press Enter to continue...\n")

        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "Unexpected error {0}".format(iothub_error) )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "" )
            print ( "IoTHubDeviceMethod sample stopped" )
    ```

1. Add the main function:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Service Client DeviceMethod Python sample..." )
        print ( "    Connection string = {0}".format(CONNECTION_STRING) )
        print ( "    Device ID         = {0}".format(DEVICE_ID) )

        iothub_devicemethod_sample_run()
    ```

1. Save and close the **CallMethodOnDevice.py** file.

## Run the apps
You are now ready to run the apps.

1. At a command prompt, run the following command to start listening for method calls from your IoT Hub:
   
    ```cmd/sh
    python SimulatedDevice.py
    ```
   
    ![][7]

1. At a command prompt, run the following command to begin monitoring your IoT hub:
   
    ```cmd/sh
    python CallMethodOnDevice.py
    ```
   
    ![][8]

1. You will see the device react to the method by printing out the message and the application which called the method display the response from the device:
   
    ![][9]

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the simulated device app to react to methods invoked by the cloud. You also created an app that invokes methods on the device and displays the response from the device.
