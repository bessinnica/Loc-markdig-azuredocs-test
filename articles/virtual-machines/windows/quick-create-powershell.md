# Create a Windows virtual machine with PowerShell

The Azure PowerShell module is used to create and manage Azure resources from the PowerShell command line or in scripts. This quickstart details using PowerShell to create and Azure virtual machine running Windows Server 2016. Once deployment is complete, we connect to the server and install IIS.  

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.1.1 or later. Run ` Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Login-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.



## Create resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location EastUS
```


## Create virtual machine

Create the virtual machine with [New-AzureRmVM](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvm). You just need to provide names for each of the resources and the New-AzureRMVM cmdlet will create them for you if they don't already exist.

When running this step, you are prompted for credentials. The values that you enter are configured as the user name and password for the virtual machine.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myVM$(Get-Random)" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" `
    -SubnetName "mySubnet" `
    -SecurityGroupName "myNetworkSecurityGroup" `
    -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" `
    -OpenPorts 80,3389  
```

## Connect to virtual machine

After the deployment has completed, create a remote desktop connection with the virtual machine.

Use the [Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermpublicipaddress) command to return the public IP address of the virtual machine. Take note of this IP Address so you can connect to it with your browser to test web connectivity in a future step.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup | Select IpAddress
```

Use the following command, on your local machine, to create a remote desktop session with the virtual machine. Replace the IP address with the *publicIPAddress* of your virtual machine. When prompted, enter the credentials used when creating the virtual machine.

```
mstsc /v:<publicIpAddress>
```

## Install IIS via PowerShell

Now that you have logged in to the Azure VM, you can use a single line of PowerShell to install IIS and enable the local firewall rule to allow web traffic. Open a PowerShell prompt on the VM and run the following command:

```azurepowershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

## View the IIS welcome page

With IIS installed and port 80 now open on your VM from the Internet, you can use a web browser of your choice to view the default IIS welcome page. Be sure to use the *publicIpAddress* you documented above to visit the default page.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quick start, youâ€™ve deployed a simple virtual machine, a network security group rule, and installed a web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Windows VMs.
