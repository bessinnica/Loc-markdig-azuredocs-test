# Copy data from Xero using Azure Data Factory (Beta)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Xero. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Copy Activity in V1](v1/data-factory-data-movement-activities.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in Beta. You can try it out and provide feedback. Do not use it in production environments.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Xero to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

All Xero tables (API endpoints) are supported except "Reports". Tables with complex items will be split to multiple tables. For example, Bank transactions has a complex data structure "LineItems", so data of bank transaction is mapped to table Bank_Transaction and Bank_Transaction_Line_Items, with Bank_Transaction_ID as foreign key to link them together.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Xero connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Xero linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Xero** | Yes |
| host | The endpoint of the Xero server (`api.xero.com`).  | Yes |
| consumerKey | The consumer key associated with the Xero application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| privateKey | The private key from the .pem file that was generated for your Xero private application. Include all the text from the .pem file, including the Unix line endings(\n). You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let the copy activity pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether the host name is required in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "XeroLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Xero",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host" : "api.xero.com",
            "consumerKey": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<consumerKey>"
            },
            "privateKey": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<privateKey>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Xero dataset.

To copy data from Xero, set the type property of the dataset to **XeroObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "XeroDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "XeroObject",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Xero linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Xero source.

### XeroSource as source

To copy data from Xero, set the source type in the copy activity to **XeroSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **XeroSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Contacts"`. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromXero",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Xero input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "XeroSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Contacts"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
