# Support matrix for Hyper-V replication to Azure


This article summarizes the supported components and settings for disaster recovery of on-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure, using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service.


## Supported scenarios

**Scenario** | **Details**
--- | --- 
**Hyper-V with VMM** | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for VMs running on Hyper-V hosts managed in the System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) fabric<br/><br/> You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal, or using PowerShell.<br/><br/> When Hyper-V hosts are managed by VMM, you can also perform disaster recovery to a secondary on-premises site. Read [this article](tutorial-vmm-to-vmm.md) to learn more about this scenario.
**Hyper-V without VMM** | You can perform disaster recovery to Azure for VMs running on Hyper-V hosts that aren't managed by VMM.<br/><br/> You can deploy this scenario in the Azure portal, or using Powershell. 


## On-premises servers

**Server** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Hyper-V (running without VMM)** | Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2 with latest updates. | When you configure a Hyper-V site in Site Recovery, mixing hosts running Windows Server 2016 and 2012 R2 isn't supported.<br/><br/> For VMs located on a host running Windows Server 2016, recovery to an alternate location isn't supported.
**Hyper-V (running with VMM)** | VMM 2016, VMM 2012 R2 | If VMM is used, Windows Server 2016 hosts should be managed in VMM 2016.<br/><br/> A VMM clouds that mixes Hyper-V hosts running on Windows Server 2016 and 2012 R2 isn't currently supported.<br/><br/> Environments that include an upgrade of an existing VMM 2012 R2 server to 2016 aren't supported.


## Replicated VMs


The following table summarizes VM support. Site Recovery supports any workloads running on a supported operating system. 

 **Component** | **Details**

## Azure VM requirements

On-premises VMs that you replicate to Azure must meet the Azure VM requirements summarized in this table.

**Component** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Guest operating system** | Site Recovery supports all operating systems that are [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868%28v=ws.10%29.aspx).  | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Guest operating system architecture** | 64-bit | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Operating system disk size** | Up to 2048 GB for Generation 1 VMs.<br/><br/> Up to 300 GB for generation 2 VMs.  | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Operating system disk count** | 1 | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Data disk count** | 16 or less  | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Data disk VHD size** | Up to 4095 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Network adapters** | Multiple adapters are supported |
**Shared VHD** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**FC disk** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Hard disk format** | VHD <br/><br/> VHDX | Site Recovery automatically converts VHDX to VHD when you fail over to Azure. When you fail back to on-premises the virtual machines continue to use the VHDX format.
**Bitlocker** | Not supported | Bitlocker must be disabled before you enable replication for a VM.
**VM name** | Between 1 and 63 characters. Restricted to letters, numbers, and hyphens. The VM name must start and end with a letter or number. | Update the value in the VM properties in Site Recovery.
**VM type** | Generation 1<br/><br/> Generation 2 -- Windows | Generation 2 VMs with an OS disk type of basic (which includes one or two data volumes formatted as VHDX) and less than 300 GB of disk space are supported.<br></br>Linux Generation 2 VMs aren't supported.
