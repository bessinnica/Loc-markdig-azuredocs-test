# View service health notifications by using the Azure portal

Service health notifications are published by Azure, and contain information about the resources under your subscription. These notifications are a sub-class of activity log events, and can also be found in the activity log. Service health notifications can be informational or actionable, depending on the class.

There are various classes of service health notifications:  

- **Action required:** Azure might notice something unusual happen on your account, and work with you to remedy this. Azure sends you a notification, either detailing the actions you need to take or how to contact Azure engineering or support.  
- **Assisted recovery:** An event has occurred and engineers have confirmed that you are still experiencing impact. Azure engineering needs to work with you directly to restore your services to full health.  
- **Incident:** An event that impacts service is currently affecting one or more of the resources in your subscription.  
- **Maintenance:** A planned maintenance activity that might impact one or more of the resources under your subscription.  
- **Information:** Potential optimizations that might help improve your resource use. 
- **Security:** Urgent security-related information regarding your solutions that run on Azure.

Each service health notification includes details on the scope and impact to your resources. Details include:
