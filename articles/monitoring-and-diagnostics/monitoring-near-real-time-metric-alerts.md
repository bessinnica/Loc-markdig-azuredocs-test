# Near Real-Time Metric Alerts (Preview)
Azure Monitor now supports a new type of metric alerts called Near Real-Time Metric Alerts (Preview). This feature is currently in public preview.
These alerts differ from regular metric alerts in few ways

- **Improved Latency** - Near real-time metric alerts can monitor changes in metric values as soon as 1 min.
- **More control over metric conditions** - Near real-time metric alerts allow users to define richer alert rules. The alerts now support monitoring the maximum, minimum, average, and total values of the metrics.
- **Combined monitoring of multiple metrics** - Near real-time metric alerts can monitor multiple metrics(currently two) with a single rule. Alert gets triggered if both the metrics breach their respective thresholds for the specified time period.
- **Modular notification system** - Near real-time metric alerts use [action groups](monitoring-action-groups.md). This functionality allows users to create actions in a modular fashion and reuse them for many alert rules.

> [!NOTE]
> Near real-time metric alerts feature is currently in public preview. The functionality and user experience is subject to change.

## Create a Near Real-Time Metric Alert
Currently, near real-time metric alerts can only be created through the Azure portal. Support for configuring near real-time metric alerts through PowerShell, command-line interface (CLI), and Azure Monitor REST API is coming soon.

The create alert experience for Near Real-Time Metric Alert has moved to the new **Alerts(Preview)** experience. Even though, the current Alerts page shows **Add Near Real-Time Metric alert**, you are redirected to the new experience.

You can create a near real-time metric alert using the steps described [here](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#create-an-alert-rule-with-the-azure-portal).

## Managing near real-time metric alerts
Once you have created a **Near Real-Time Metric alert**, it can be managed using the steps described [here](monitor-alerts-unified-usage.md#managing-your-alerts-in-azure-portal).

## Payload schema

The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all near real-time metric alerts.
